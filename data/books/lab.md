**INTRODUCTION**

T

o offer holistic care to patients, nurses and health care workers need to

identify abnormal laboratory values and diagnostic data. Although the onus of

diagnosis and ordering lab tests lies with the physician, it is important for

nurses to be aware of the purpose of tests, their meaning, and the normal ranges for

each one being ordered.

The ability to identify normal and abnormal values of a lab test is an important

asset to make an informed clinical decision as a nurse. Laboratory tests are tools

that give invaluable information and insight about a patient and help in care and

honing nursing acumen. Lab tests aid in confirming the diagnosis, provide the

prognosis of an illness, and suggest the patient's response to treatment.

The laboratory is an important part of the NCLEX, yet some values give no

indication of the normal range of lab levels. It is the responsibility of nursing

personnel to identify whether lab values are within the normal range or not as it is

of vital import. Note that laboratory values will vary from institution to institution.

Easy memorization tricks to help on exams are in a separate chapter of this book.

You can glance through this single chapter just before the exams rather than sifting

through all chapters if there is a time constraint.

**BASIC PROCEDURES**

**HOW TO OBTAIN A BLOOD SAMPLE**

A phlebotomist or certified nurse with training in blood specimen collection is

allowed to perform venipuncture for the purpose of blood sample collection. The

procedure includes the following steps:

• Identify the patient: ask his or her name and date of birth and explain the

rationale and test procedure.

• Proper position: blood specimens are best drawn in a sitting position, and

the patient should remain in the same position without movement for a

minimum of 5 minutes before the sample is drawn.

• Confirm the lab test requested: look at the laboratory form for the ordered

test, the patient information, and other requisites like allergies, fasting,

dietary restrictions, and medications.

• Offer comfort: make sure the patient is not wearing tight clothing that

could constrict the upper arm. The arm is to be placed in a gravitating

position.

• Ensure proper hand hygiene: hands should be washed properly before

wearing gloves.

• Identify the vein: inspect the patient's arm for an easily accessible vein for

venipuncture, and then the tourniquet is to be applied 3 to 4 inches above

the chosen site. Ensure that the tourniquet is not too tight and do not leave

it on for more than 2 minutes.

• Prepare the site: cleanse the area of the chosen vein using alcohol in

circular movements, beginning at the center of the site and working

outward.

• Draw the sample: ask the patient to make a fist. Hold the patient's arm

using your thumb firmly to make the skin taut and position the vein to

prevent it from slipping at an angle of 15 to 30º. Gently insert the needle

through the skin into the lumen of the vein.

• Fill the tube: collect the amount of blood sample required and then remove

the tourniquet.

• Remove the needle: in a single and swift motion, remove the needle from

the patient's vein and apply pressure with a folded gauze over the

venipuncture site for 1 to 2 minutes.

• Label the tube: the tube should be labeled correctly with the patient's

name, birth date, hospital identification number, time, and date of the

sample collected.

• Transport specimen: the specimen should be delivered to the laboratory

immediately for processing and analysis.

**PHASES OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING**

Diagnostic testing has three phases: pretest, intratest, and post-test. Each phase

involves different roles and responsibilities.

**PRETEST**

In the pretest, the primary focus is on preparing the patient for the procedure.

Responsibilities include:

\- Assessment of the patient to determine precautions for the procedure

\- Preparation of the equipment and supplies needed

\- Preparation of a consent form, if required

\- Providing information and answering queries of the patient about the procedure

**INTRATEST**

The intratest focuses mainly on specimen collection and performing or assisting

with certain diagnostic procedures. Additional responsibilities during an intratest

are:

• Standard precautions need to be employed, and sterile techniques to be used

when indicated

• Monitoring the patient's response during the procedure and providing

emotional support to the patient

• Ensure correct labeling, storage, and transportation of the specimen to the

laboratory

**POST-TEST**

In the last part of diagnostic testing, nursing care is mainly focused on observations

and patient follow-up. Additional responsibilities during post-test include:

• Comparison of previous and current test results

• The appropriate members of the healthcare team is to be notified of the

results



<a name="br7"></a> 

**ERYTHROCYTE STUDIES**

A

n erythrocyte called a red blood cell (RBC) is a type of cell produced in the

bone marrow and found in the blood. Red blood cells develop in the fetal

liver or the adult bone marrow via erythropoiesis. Erythropoiesis is a process

stimulated by erythropoietin, a cytokine hormone, produced in the kidney when

oxygen levels are low. RBCs are the primary cells in the body's respiratory system

as they are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to all the peripheral

parts of the body via hemoglobin; and they are very important for nearly all the

basic physiologic processes. The number of erythrocytes in the blood is usually part

of a complete blood count (CBC) test.

The lab values related to red blood cell studies include hemoglobin, red blood cell

count, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum iron. Venous blood is

used for an analysis of a complete blood count (CBC), a primary screening test

ordered to give an idea of the health of a patient. Laboratories generally prefer

venous blood since if there is any need to check or repeat a test, additional blood is

already available without having to get another specimen from the patient.

Erythrocyte studies are used to look for conditions such as anemia, dehydration,

malnutrition, and leukemia. Red blood cells are the most numerous cells of the

body. In normal blood there are about 5 million red blood cells per microliter. The

normal red blood cell or erythrocyte is shaped like a biconcave disc such that it is

thicker at the periphery and thinner in the center. They undergo multiple tightly

regulated processes in order to remodel their structure, starting with the loss of the

complex organelles system and the consequent acquisition of the typical biconcave

shape. The disc has rounded edges.

RBCs have a flexible structure, making them capable of deforming to travel

through the smallest blood vessels - the capillaries. The RBC, especially due to its

membrane, renders the aging RBC unfit to circulate, leading to its destruction by

the liver, spleen, and reticuloendothelial system. The average RBC remains in

circulation for about 120 days. The RBC has a thin semi-permeable covering

membrane made up of lipids strengthened by proteins with attached carbohydrates.

Red blood cells have an average diameter of 7.3 micrometers. When stained, RBCs

appear darker at the periphery and lighter in the center due to variations in

hemoglobin in different parts of the cell.

The RBCs in the peripheral blood do not contain a nucleus. They lose their nuclei

during maturation and just before their release from bone marrow where they are

formed. However, certain disease conditions show nucleated RBCs in the

peripheral blood. RBCs also have a tendency to collect together like a pile of coins,

which is called the Rouleaux formation.

The most crucial function of the red blood cell is to carry oxygen from the lung to

the tissues and bring back carbon dioxide from these tissues to the lungs for

excretion. It also aids in maintaining an acid-base balance. As RBCs do not have

nuclei and are no longer manufacturing proteins or other substances, they use very

little oxygen for their own metabolism. Thus, they are very good oxygen carriers.



<a name="br8"></a> 

Red blood cells also induce vasodilation by mediating the effects of nitric oxide.

They are involved in the process of thrombosis and hemostasis and have an

important role in the immune response against pathogens.



<a name="br9"></a> 

**RED BLOOD CELL (RBC) COUNT**

RBCs or erythrocytes are biconcave-shaped cells that carry oxygen from the lungs

to the tissues and carry carbon dioxide from the peripheral tissues to the lung. They

have a lifespan of 120 days and are removed from the blood by the liver, spleen,

and bone marrow, which are a part of the reticuloendothelial system.

**NORMAL RANGES**

●

●

Male Adult: 4.5 - 6.2 million cells/cumm

Female Adult: 4.5 - 5 million cells/cumm

**INDICATIONS**

To determine anemia, polycythemia, dehydration or response to treatment.

**INTERPRETATION**

RBCs increase either due to relative decrease in plasma as in hemoconcentration or

dehydration or as a result of an absolute increase in hematopoietin, as in renal cell

carcinoma.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Hemoconcentration, dehydration, smokers, acute stress, polycythemia vera, high

altitude and renal cell carcinoma.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Anemias, hemolysis, hemorrhage, failure of marrow production, chronic renal

failure.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Conditions that increase plasma volume like pregnancy do not reflect absolute

anemia. Conditions like dehydration do not reflect absolute polycythemia due to

decreased plasma volume.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Explain the procedure of the test, encourage avoiding stress, and explain that

fasting is not required. Apply a dressing over the puncture site, monitor the

puncture site for oozing and hematoma formation. Then the patient can resume

normal activities and diet.



<a name="br10"></a> 

**HEMOGLOBIN**

Hemoglobin is the protein component of red blood cells that acts as a carrier for

oxygen and carbon dioxide transport. It is composed of heme (a pigment) that

carries iron, and globin (a protein).

**NORMA L RANGES**

●

●

●

Male adult: 14 - 16.5 g/dl

Female adult: 12 - 16 g/dl

Critical values: <5 g/dl or >20g/dl

**INDICATIONS**

To measure severity of anemia or polycythemia and to monitor response to therapy.

**INTERPRETATION**

Low hemoglobin indicates anemia, characterized by an insufficient RBC count to

deliver oxygen to peripheral tissues. High hemoglobin indicates polycythemia

when the hemoglobin is more than 18.5g/dl in men and 16.5g/dl in women.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Polycythemia vera, burns, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congenital heart

disease, congestive heart disease, dehydration.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Anemia, nutritional deficiency, hemolysis, hemorrhage, lymphoma, kidney disease,

splenomegaly, cancer, neoplasia.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Conditions that cause changes in plasma volume without changes in overall RBC

cell count can also affect the Hb and may lead to relative anemia or relative

polycythemia.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Manage fatigue, maintain adequate nutrition, maintain adequate perfusion and

encourage patient compliance with prescribed therapy.



<a name="br11"></a> 

**HEMATOCRIT (PACKED CELL VOLUME)**

Hematocrit is the volume of packed red cells in a particular specimen of blood

calculated as a percentage of total volume of blood.

**NORMAL RANGES**

●

●

Male adult: 42 -52%

Female adult: 35 - 47%

**INDICATIONS**

Hematocrit shows that a patient has anemia, erythrocytosis, or changes in plasma

volume. Hematocrit value is used as a cutoff to determine the amount of

requirement for transfusion.

**INTERPRETATION**

Hematocrit is raised with an increase in the number of red blood cells or a decrease

in plasma volume. Hematocrit falls in decreased erythropoiesis or hemolysis and

hemorrhage where plasma volume is increased. Hematocrit may be measured by

centrifugation or automated methods.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Polycythemia vera, burns, COPD, congenital heart disease, dehydration, eclampsia.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Anemia, hemoglobinopathy, bone marrow failure, hemorrhage, hemolytic reaction,

normal pregnancy, multiple myeloma.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

People living in high altitudes have a high HCT. Hemodilution of pregnancy causes

decreased HCT. Lower HCT is seen in men and women over the age of 60. Severe

dehydration causes a false increase in HCT.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Manage fatigue, avoid complications of anemia, maintain adequate nutrition,

maintain adequate perfusion, and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy.



<a name="br12"></a> 

**RED BLOOD CELL INDICES**

Red blood cell indices determine the characteristics of an RBC. RBC indices aid in

diagnosis of anemias and liver diseases.

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): average size of the individual RBC

Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH): amount of Hgb present in one cell

Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC): proportion of each cell

occupied by the Hgb

**NORMAL RANGES**

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): Male: 78 – 100 μm3; Female: 78 – 102 μm3

Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH): 25 – 35pg

Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC): 31 – 37%

**INDICATIONS**

RBC counts and RBC indices are used to diagnose different types of anemias.

**INTERPRETATION**

RBC indices can help to identify the cause of anemia. The MCV is the most

important value in the RBC indices that help in identifying the type of anemia .

**INCREASED LEVELS**

HIGH MCV: vitamin B12 deficiency, Folate deficiency, Chemotherapy

HIGH MCHC: hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease

**DECREASED LEVELS**

LOW MCV: iron deficiency, thalassemia, lead poisoning, chronic diseases

LOW MCHC: thalassemia, iron deficiency, lead poisoning

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperuremia.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Explain the test procedure, encourage avoiding stress, explain that this test does not

require fasting, apply manual pressure and dressing over puncture site and watch

for oozing or hematoma formation.



<a name="br13"></a> 

**SERUM IRON**

Iron is essential for blood formation and helps in the transport of oxygen in the

lungs to the peripheral tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs.

**NORMAL RANGES**

Male adult: 65 – 175 mcg/dL

Female adult: 50 – 170 mcg/dL

**INDICATIONS**

Helps in diagnosing anemias and hemolytic disorders.

**INTERPRETATION**

Iron deficiency anemia develops when stores of iron in the body fall too low to

support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Hemochromatosis is diagnosed

when elevated serum iron levels are present, usually an incidental finding on

routine screening.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, hemolytic anemia, iron poisoning, hepatic

necrosis, hepatitis, lead toxicity.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Iron deficiency anemia, chronic blood loss, chronic hematuria, chronic pathologic

menstruation, neoplasia, late stages of pregnancy.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

If iron deficiency anemia patients are on iron supplements before blood is drawn,

normal or high concentrations of iron are noted.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

A recent intake of a meal containing high iron content may affect the results. Drugs

that cause decreased iron levels include colchicine, deferoxamine,

adrenocorticotropic hormone, cholestyramine, and testosterone. Drugs that may

cause increased iron levels include iron preparations, dextrans, ethanol, estrogens,

methyldopa, and oral contraceptives .



<a name="br14"></a> 

**ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE(ESR)**

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a measurement of the rate at which

erythrocytes settle in a blood sample within one hour.

**NORMAL RANGE**

0-30 mm/hour (value depends on age)

**INDICATIONS**

indicated in diagnosis of acute or chronic infections, inflammation, tissue necrosis

and infarction.

**INTERPRETATION**

Increased ESR levels indicate a current ongoing infection, inflammation, tissue

necrosis and infarction.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Bacterial infection, inflammatory disease, malignant diseases, chronic renal failure,

hyperfibrinogenemia, severe anemia.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Polycythemia vera, sickle cell anemia, hypofibrinogenemia and spherocytosis.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Technical factors such as room temperature, time from specimen collection,

vibration, inclination/orientation of the ESR tube can affect the results of the test.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Fasting is not required, fatty meals before tests may alter the plasma factors



<a name="br15"></a> 

**WHITE BLOOD CELL AND DIFFERENTIAL**

T

he leukocytes or white blood cells are another of the formed elements of the

blood. The WBC (white blood cell count) is a count of the number of white

blood cells in a certain volume of blood. They are present in lesser numbers

than the RBC in the blood. They account for 1 WBC for every 500 RBC’s. White

blood cells (leukocytes) are classified into myeloid (neutrophils/polymorphs,

eosinophils, basophils, monocytes) and lymphoid (lymphocytes). The neutrophils,

eosinophils, and basophils are also called granulocytes because their cytoplasm

contains granules. Leucocytes are larger than RBCs as they all have a nucleus.

An automated hematology analyzer performs the test.

The total white blood cell count is an absolute number, and the subtypes of white

blood cells are given as a differential WBC count, expressed as an absolute number

or as a percentage. Microscopy is done to study the nuclei and other characteristics

of the WBC. A blood smear is prepared and stained with Giemsa stain or Leishman

stain for microscopy.

The defense of the body against foreign bodies, infections, and other substances is

the job of the white blood cells. The differential count provides specific

information on subtypes of WBCs:

Neutrophils are the foremost common form of WBC and are the first line of

defense against pyogenic infections. They are actively motile and get attracted to

places where an infection is going on or are drawn by various chemical stimuli in

the body. With the help of antibodies, the neutrophil can ingest (phagocytose), kill,

and digest harmful organisms that enter the body.

Lymphocytes play an enormous role in response to inflammation or infection. They

are mononuclear cells and are motile. They are divided into two main types: The B

lymphocyte and the T lymphocyte. The B lymphocyte is derived from bone marrow

precursors and are stimulated by the attachment to their membranes of specific

antigens and create antibodies. These cells transform into plasma cells, which

create specific immunoglobulins. The T lymphocytes processed in the thymus are

responsible for tissue immunity, which is seen when these lymphocytes kill cells

infected with virus. They also play a role in tissue response to organ transplants and

certain tumor cells. Lymphocytes are not phagocytic but play a very important role

in immunity against various infections.

Monocytes are large mononuclear and phagocytic cells that act by killing and

digesting the foreign organism (phagocytosis), and they respond to infection,

inflammation, and foreign bodies). They also act as scavengers to remove inert

matter, foreign bodies, dead cells, and other substances. The monocyte in the blood

is an earlier stage of the phagocytic cell in tissue, called a macrophage. The

monocytes not only present the processed antigen to the lymphocyte but they also

produce a substance that activates the T lymphocytes to proliferate. They secrete

the plasminogen activator factor and some of the components of complement. They

are also the main source of pyrogen, which causes body temperature to rise (fever).



<a name="br16"></a> 

Eosinophils are motile; they localize to substances released by mast cells and

sensitized lymphocytes. They are also phagocytic. They are often found attached to

foreign agents such as adult worms and are increased in allergic reactions and

parasitic infections.

Basophils are the chief carriers of histamine in the blood, the release of which is

associated with hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. They respond to allergies,

inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. They also carry and release heparin.

Band forms are the first immature WBCs that are released into the blood.

The production of WBCs occurs in the bone marrow by hematopoiesis by the

multipotential progenitor cells/hematopoietic stem cells. They are a crucial part of

the immune system and play a vital role in the body's defense mechanism. The

WBC count and differential count are used to assess the body's response to benign

and malignant conditions such as acute and chronic infections, inflammatory

conditions, allergic reactions, immunodeficiency states, leukemias, and

lymphomas. It is also used for assessing prognosis, response to chemotherapy,

growth factors, and immunosuppression.

A white blood cell (WBC) count lower than 4000 cells/cumm is called leukopenia.

A count of more than 11000 cells/cumm is known as leukocytosis.

WBC count is decreased in hematopoietic stem cell disorders that do disrupt the

normal growth and maturation in the bone marrow, as seen in myelodysplastic

syndrome, leukemia or when the supply is depleted by treatments such as

chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

WBC count is elevated, that is leukocytosis, and seen in response to infection,

inflammatory disorders (referred to as reactive leukocytosis), stress or abnormal

production as in leukemia.

The malignant proliferation of white blood cells also causes leukocytosis. These

abnormal clones of white blood cells show malignant proliferation in the bone

marrow and are classified as lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms, depending upon the

sub-type of white cell proliferation. These malignancies are further divided by the

type of differentiation of the individual cell types and are classified as chronic

leukemias such as chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and

acute leukemia conditions like acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic

leukemia.



<a name="br17"></a> 

**WHITE BLOOD CELLS (WBC)**

White blood cells are the first line of defense against foreign bodies and other

substances. The WBC count assesses the total amount of white blood cells in a

cubic millimeter of blood. The differential count provides specific information

about the WBC subtypes: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and

basophils.

**NORMAL RANGE**

WBC Count: 4500-11000 cells per cumm.

Neutrophils 55-70%, Lymphocytes 20-40%, Monocytes 2-8%, Eosinophils 1-4%,

Basophils 0-2%.

**INDICATIONS**

A crucial part of our [immune](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1948753-overview)[ ](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1948753-overview)[system](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1948753-overview)[ ](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1948753-overview)are white blood cells; they protect our bodies

against infection and other foreign substances. The white blood cell count and

differential shows the body’s response to acute and chronic infections,

inflammatory conditions, allergic reactions, immunodeficiency states, leukemias

and lymphomas.

**INTERPRETATION**

A leucocyte count of less than 4000 cells/cumm is leucopenia. A leucocyte count of

more than 11000 cells/cumm is leukocytosis.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Leucocytosis: inflammation, Infection, Leukemic neoplasia, stress, trauma

Neutrophilic leucocytosis: Acute bacterial infections, myocardial infarction, burns,

crush injuries.

Lymphocytosis: viral infections, pertussis Accompanies monocytosis,

Eosinophilia: Allergic disorders, drug reactions, Parasitic infections

Basophilia: Rare allergic reactions and acute leukemias

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Bone marrow failure, autoimmune disease, congenital aplasia, drug toxicity.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Acute physical or emotional stress can cause an elevated leukocyte count.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

A “shift to the right” indicates that the neutrophils are mature and have

more nuclear segments than usual. A “shift to the left” indicates more

immature neutrophils in the blood.

**COAGULATION STUDIES**

I

n the normal adult, about 5 liters of liquid blood are being pumped around the

body through the circulatory system. The body has mechanisms to keep all that

blood in a fluid state as it circulates, while also having the potential to gel or

coagulate should it become necessary. Other mechanisms maintain and repair any

damage to the vessels, which result in leakage.Yet other and mechanisms reliquefy

blood that has clotted in order to reopen vessels that become closed or occluded

(thrombosed).

There is normally a constant and dynamic balance between the various forces or

mechanisms involved in hemostasis. Hemostasis is a word used that includes all the

factors and mechanisms that help keep the circulating blood fluid, maintain the

integrity of the vessel wall, and control bleeding if a vessel break occurs. The term

hemostasis thus includes coagulation of the plasma and the mechanisms and actions

of the blood vessel themselves, along with the contribution of platelets.

Generally, one needs normal functioning of all three components (vessels, platelets

and plasma) to ensure normal hemostasis. Usually, a mild dysfunction can be

compensated by one or both of the others so there is no clinical problem, no

bleeding. and no thrombosis - at least without major trauma. A person with mild

dysfunction might never have had any bleeding over years of normal life only to

develop major bleeding during surgery or after being in a major accident. On the

other hand, if two or all three of the components have some abnormality at the

same time, then clinical dysfunction is nearly always seen.

Coagulation studies are done to assess the clotting function in an individual. The

panel of tests include platelet count, prothrombin time, international normalized

ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, and D-dimer.

The hemostatic system is composed of platelets, coagulation factors, and the

endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. The fragmentation of the cytoplasm of

megakaryocytes generates platelets in the bone marrow, and they circulate in blood

as tiny anucleate disc-shaped particles with a lifespan of 7-10 days. Normally

thrombosis is prevented by the endothelial cell linings’ resistance to interacting

with platelets and coagulation factors. When there is injury to the endothelial

continuity, the underlying matrix gets exposed, and a continuous series of events

are set in action to seal the primary defect (primary hemostasis). Platelets interact

with the subendothelium-bound von Willebrand factor (vWf) via the membrane

glycoprotein (GP) Ib complex and play a primary role in this process. This initial

interaction (platelet adhesion) leads to other adhesive reactions that allow the

platelets to aggregate and form a clot.

The coagulation pathway needs to be understood to interpret prothrombin time

(PT). A measure of the integrity of the extrinsic and final common pathways of the

coagulation cascade gives the prothrombin time. It is made up of tissue factor and

factors VII, II (prothrombin),V, X, and fibrinogen. Thromboplastin, an activator of

the extrinsic pathway and calcium, is added to the blood sample and then the time

(in seconds) is noted that is required for fibrin clot formation.



<a name="br19"></a> 

Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)

are used to test the same function, but in aPTT test, an activator is added to speed

up the clotting time and therefore a narrower reference range is obtained. The aPTT

is more sensitive than PTT and is therefore preferred to monitor the patient’s

response to heparin therapy.

The international normalized ratio is a standardized number and deduced in the lab;

therefore, it varies from institute to institute. It is important to check INR in

patients on anticoagulants, also called blood thinners or anti-clotting medicines.

The INR is deduced using prothrombin time (PT) test results. INR measures the

time taken for blood to clot and is an international standard for the PT. The INR test

is done to see how well the blood clots.

Bleeding time is a test to assess the body’s ability to form a clot as well as platelet

function. The test involves pricking a needle in a superficial area of the skin and

monitoring the duration of time needed for bleeding to stop (i.e., the bleeding site

turns "glassy").

D-dimer is the degradation product of crosslinked (by factor XIII) fibrin. The

current activation of the hemostatic system is identified by this test. The reference

range of D-dimer is < 250 ng/mL, or < 0.4 mcg/mL.

Each laboratory establishes a reference range/cutoff value for D-dimer or, if a lab

wants to use a published cut off value from the literature, the same methodology

should be used to determine the value and preferably from the same manufacturer.

Latex agglutination–based kits are available for point-of-care testing to determine

the semiquantitative amount of D-dimer. This test is less clinically valuable as it

has high interobserver variability.

An automated point-of-care D-dimer test has been developed that gives quantitative

results, providing an excellent, cost-effective, and rapid tool, especially in the

emergency setting to rule out pulmonary embolism among patients with a low

probability of occurrence.

**PLATELETS**

The production of platelets occurs in the bone marrow by the fragmentation of

megakaryocytes and play a vital role in hemostasis. Platelets function in

hemostasis, retraction of the clot, and activation of coagulation factors.

**NORMAL RANGE**

150,000 to 400,000 cells/mm³

**INDICATIONS**

Platelets are counted to diagnose and monitor diseases and also to look for the

causes of excessive bleeding or clotting.

**INTERPRETATION**

A platelet count of less than 150000 cells/cumm is thrombocytopenia and platelet

count of more than 4,00000 cells/cumm is thrombocytosis.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Iron deficiency anemia, post splenectomy, polycythemia vera, rheumatoid arthritis

and malignant disorders.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Immune thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia, disseminated intra

vascular coagulation, cancer, chemotherapy, hemorrhage, haemolytic anemia, and

infection.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Platelet clumps are formed in capillary collections. Viral infections, drugs and

chemotherapeutic medicines also cause platelet aggregates.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

In thrombocytopenia, the venipuncture site should be assessed. Increased platelets

are seen in high altitudes, persistent cold temperature, and strenuous exercise.

Caution should be observed in patients with low platelet counts for bleeding.



<a name="br21"></a> 

**ACTIVATED PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME(APTT)**

APTT evaluates the length of time to form a blood clot. It is a measure of the

intrinsic and coagulation pathway sequence. It gives the measurement of the

amount of time required for citrated recalcified plasma to clot after partial

thromboplastin is added to it. It is a screening test for deficiencies and inhibitors of

all factors, except factors VII and XIII.

**NORMAL RANGE:**

20 to 60 seconds (depends on the activator used).

**INDICATIONS**

To monitor heparin therapy, detects coagulation disorders of hemophilia A and

hemophilia B.

**INTERPRETATION**

A normal APTT with an abnormal PT means that the extrinsic pathway has a

defect. An abnormal APTT with normal PT means that the intrinsic pathway is

defective.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemophilia, heparin administration,

Congenital clotting factor deficiency, leukaemia, a vitamin K deficiency.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Disseminated intravascular coagulation in the early phase of cancer.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Certain drugs prolong the values. Incorrect blood to citrate ratio may alter values. A

high or low hematocrit alters values.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Samples should be drawn from an arm into which a heparin infusion is not being

given. Apply manual pressure to the venipuncture site. The blood specimen should

be transported to the laboratory immediately, The aPTT should measure between

1\.5 and 2.5 times the normal if the patient is receiving heparin anticoagulation

therapy. Signs of bleeding should be looked for if the aPTT value is more than 90

seconds.



<a name="br22"></a> 

**PROTHROMBIN TIME / INTERNATIONAL NORMALIZED**

**RATIO (PT/INR)**

Prothrombin is essential for fibrin clot formation; it is a vitamin K-dependent

glycoprotein produced in the liver. The PT gives the measure of the amount of time

taken in seconds for formation of the clot. The international normalized ratio (INR)

is used to monitor the effectiveness of Warfarin and is deduced from the result of

PT.

**NORMAL RANGE**

Normal: 11 – 13 seconds.

Critical value: >20 seconds for patients not on anticoagulants .

Th e INR is calculated in each laboratory and is specific to the thromboplastin

reagent used . INR standardizes the PT.

**INDICATIONS**

Screen for extrinsic clotting system dysfunction screening, monitor response to

Coumadin therapy.

**INTERPRETATION**

A prothrombin time (PT) test diagnoses excessive clotting and a bleeding disorder.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Certain drugs may prolong the values. Incorrect blood to citrate ratio may alter

values. Hematocrit results may alter values.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Do not draw samples from an arm where there is a heparin infusion. Apply pressure

to the venipuncture site. The blood specimen should be transported to the

laboratory immediately. Monitor for signs of bleeding if the aPTT value is more

than 90 seconds.

Willebrand’s disease, capillary fragility, collagen vascular disease, connective

tissue disorder, Cushing’s Syndrome, hereditary telangiectasia, hypersplenism,

leukemia.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Anything that alters platelet function can interfere with bleeding time. Examples

include aspirin, thrombocytopenia, and uremia. The test procedure and subjective

observation by the technician performing the test are also factors that can interfere

with the results.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Assess and confirm that the patient has not been on anticoagulants, [aspirin](https://nurseslabs.com/salicylates/)[ ](https://nurseslabs.com/salicylates/), or

aspirin-containing products for 3 days prior to the test. Inform the patient about the

procedure of the test. Apply pressure dressing to patients with bleeding tendencies

after the procedure.



<a name="br24"></a> 

**D-DIMER TEST**

anticoagulation therapy, comfort the patient, encourage exercise and movement,

positioning of the body, maintaining adequate tissue perfusion and preventing

complications.



<a name="br25"></a> 

**SERUM ELECTROLYTES**

E

lectrolytes are minerals that play an essential role in the most important bodily

functions. Serum electrolytes are screening tests in patients with electrolyte

and acid-base imbalances. The commonly ordered serum electrolyte panels include

serum potassium, serum sodium, serum chloride, and serum bicarbonate.

Electrolytes are elements that are ionized in solution and migrate in an electric

field. They are called cations or anions, depending upon whether they migrate

toward the cathode or the anode. The major cations found in body fluids are

sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The major anions found in the body

fluids are chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate and sulfate.

There are a number of other substances in body fluid that are ionized and carry an

electric charge in a solution, including some organic acid radicals such as lactate,

amino acids, proteins and various other trace elements. In this chapter, we discuss

sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus.

Electrolytes are involved in all body processes. They are involved in maintaining

normal osmotic pressure as well as water distribution throughout the body both

within the cell and the extracellular fluid. They are a major part of many metabolic

processes. Any imbalance in electrolytes will have widespread effects in the body.

Serum potassium is an electrolyte and mineral in the blood whose value can be

assessed by blood tests. Potassium has a narrow normal range and is vital to the

function of the heart muscle and nerve cells. Potassium is ingested in food and

beverages and primarily excreted through urine. A small portion is excreted through

the gastrointestinal tract. Deranged potassium levels are notorious in causing

irregular heartbeats or arrhythmias.

Serum sodium is routinely measured in assessing acid-base and water balance,

electrolyte changes, as well as in assessing kidney function. Approximately 95% of

the osmotically active substances in the extracellular compartment fluid is made up

of sodium. Sodium is regulated by hormonal influences and any excess is removed

by the kidneys, which carefully regulate the extracellular sodium.

Serum chloride exists in the extracellular space and is a predominant anion.

Cellular integrity is maintained by chloride and its effects on water balance and

osmotic pressure, along with maintaining acid-base balance. Chloride also has a

major role in cardiovascular pathophysiology and neuronal pharmacology.

Serum calcium is one of the most abundant elements in the adult body. Calcium

constitutes approximately 2% of adult body weight, which accounts for over 1 kg

of calcium. All the calcium is contained in the bones as calcium hydroxyapatite,

except 1%. All the calcium of the blood is present in the plasma. About 40% of

serum calcium is attached to proteins.



<a name="br26"></a> 

About 10% exists as inorganic and organic anions of bicarbonate, lactate, and

citrate; the rest of 50% of the calcium in circulation is free, known as ionized

calcium. Calcium ions are essential to the functioning of the nervous system; the

contractility of heart and skeletal muscles are maintained by calcium ions. Calcium

is also associated with blood clotting and mineralization of the bone. The

parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-hydroxy vitamin D tightly regulate the

calcium concentration in circulation.

Elemental phosphorus is not found in free form in the body and only present as part

of organic and inorganic compounds. Like calcium, about 85% of phosphates are

present primarily in an inorganic form (hydroxyapatite) in our skeletons. Around

15% is present as organic compounds in our soft tissue and circulation.

Laboratory tests give a measure of organically bound phosphorus. The most

important intracellular cation in the body is magnesium. Magnesium has a major

role in normal neuromuscular activity, along with extracellular calcium.

Additionally, intracellular magnesium is an important cofactor for nucleic acids,

various enzymes and transporters that are vital for replication, energy metabolism,

and normal cellular function.



<a name="br27"></a> 

**SERUM POTASSIUM (K+)**

Potassium serves important functions in the body such as regulating acid-base

[equilibrium](https://nurseslabs.com/special-senses-anatomy-physiology/)[ ](https://nurseslabs.com/special-senses-anatomy-physiology/), cellular water balance, and transmitting electrical impulses in skeletal

and cardiac muscles. It is the most abundant intracellular cation.

**NORMAL RANGE**

3\.5 - 5 mEq/L

**INDICATIONS**

Assesses renal function, cardiac function, gastrointestinal function and indicates the

need for IV replacement therapy.

**INTERPRETATION**

Hyperkalemia occurs when the potassium level is more than the upper limit of the

normal range. Hyperkalemias are notorious to cause lethal arrhythmias and hence

one of the most important serum electrolytes.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Acidosis, dehydration, acute or chronic renal failure, aldosterone-inhibiting

diuretics, hemolysis, hypoaldosteronism, excessive IV intake.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Diuretics, hyperaldosteronism, gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea and

vomiting, ascites, burns, Cushing’s syndrome, cystic fibrosis.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Platelet clumps are commonly seen in capillary collections. Viral infections, drugs

and chemotherapeutic medicines are also prone to cause platelet aggregates.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Make a note on the laboratory request form if the patient is on potassium

supplements. Falsely elevated potassium levels may be seen in patients with

elevated white blood cell and platelet counts.



<a name="br28"></a> 

**SERUM SODIUM (Na+)**

Sodium is a major extracellular fluid action that maintains osmotic pressure and

acid-base balance. It also mediates transmission of nerve impulses. Sodium ion

absorption takes place in the small intestine and is excreted in the urine, depending

upon dietary intake.

**NORMAL RANGE**

135-145 mEq/L

**INDICATIONS**

Monitor the effectiveness of drugs, especially diuretics, on serum sodium levels.

Determine whole-body sodium stores, as sodium is a predominantly extracellular

ion.

Chronic renal insufficiency, deficient dietary intake, diarrhea, diuretic

administration, pleural effusion, ascites, Addison’s disease, congestive heart failure,

syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) secretion, vomiting or nasogastric

aspiration.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Fluid imbalance, acute illness, and diuretics.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Blood samples should not be drawn from an extremity in which an intravenous (IV)

solution of sodium chloride is infusing as it increases the level, producing

inaccurate results.



<a name="br29"></a> 

**SERUM CHLORIDE (Cl-)**

Chloride is a salt of hydrochloric acid and one of the most abundant body anions in

extracellular fluid. It acts as a buffer during oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in

red blood cells (RBCs) and also counterbalances cations like sodium. Chloride also

helps in digestion as a part of the hydrochloric acid and in maintaining osmotic

pressure and water balance.

**NORMAL RANGE**

95 – 105 mEq/L

**INDICATIONS**

Serum chloride assesses the water balance and acid base status.

**INTERPRETATION**

Chloride is an extracellular fluid anion that mainly exists as sodium chloride or

hydrochloric acid. Hyperchloremia means high levels of serum chloride above the

upper limit of the normal range, and hypochloremia means low levels of serum

chloride below the lower limit of the normal range.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Dehydration, metabolic acidosis, renal tubular acidosis, respiratory alkalosis,

eclampsia, excessive infusion of normal saline, anemia, Cushing’s Syndrome,

hyperparathyroidism, hyperventilation, kidney dysfunction.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

salt-losing nephritis, Addison’s disease, aldosteronism, burns, chronic respiratory

acidosis, congestive heart failure, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone

(siadh).

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Excessive IV saline infusions can result in high values. Infants tend to have higher

levels of chloride than adults and children. Certain drugs can alter chloride levels

(i.e., loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics)

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Any condition associated with prolonged vomiting, diarrhea, or both will alter

chloride levels.



<a name="br30"></a> 

**SERUM BICARBONATE**

Sodium bicarbonate regulates the pH of body fluids and forms a part bicarbonate-

carbonic acid buffering system of the body .

**NORMAL RANGE:**

22 to 29 mEq/L

**INDICATIONS**

Helps to diagnose an electrolyte imbalance, acidosis or alkalosis. Bicarbonate is

part of a metabolic and electrolyte panel.

**INTERPRETATION**

It raises blood pH acts as a buffer against acidosis. Bicarbonate reacts with H+ ions

to form water and carbon dioxide.

**ACIDOSIS AND ALKALOSIS**

Conditions or diseases that affect the lungs, kidneys, metabolism, or breathing is a

potential to cause acidosis or alkalosis.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Metabolic alkalosis is a condition that increases the pH in tissues that causes a high

level of bicarbonate in the blood. Metabolic alkalosis can be due to a loss of acid

from the body, as seen during vomiting and dehydration.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Acidic or alkaline solutions ingestion may cause increased or decreased results.



<a name="br31"></a> 

**CALCIUM**

Calcium (Ca+) is a cation that facilitates nerve impulse transmission, contraction of

myocardial and skeletal muscles, and bone formation. Calcium is absorbed from

dietary sources into the bloodstream and helps clotting of blood by converting

prothrombin to thrombin.

**NORMAL RANGE**

Calcium ( total calcium): 4.5 – 5.5 mEq/L (8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL)

Calcium ( ionized): 2.5 mEq/L (4.0 – 5.0 mg/dL)

**INDICATIONS**

Serum calcium levels above 11.5 mg/dL cause symptoms. 12 mg/dL and above are

critical values, and levels above 15 mg/dL is a medical emergency.

**INTERPRETATION**

Hypocalcemia is total serum calcium concentrations below the lower limit of the

age and sex appropriate reference interval. Hypercalcemia occurs when the calcium

levels are above the upper limit of the reference range.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Paget’s disease of the bone, acromegaly,

granulomatous infections, lymphoma, metastatic tumor to the bone, renal or lung

carcinoma.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Hypoparathyroidism, Rickets, vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, osteomalacia,

pancreatitis, alkalosis, fat embolism, renal failure.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Drugs and bilirubin commonly compete with calcium for albumin binding.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Inform the patient that fasting may be required for 8 hours before the test. The

patient should eat a normal calcium level diet for 3 days before the exam.



<a name="br32"></a> 

**PHOSPHOROUS (P)**

Phosphorus is present as phosphate and plays an important role in formation of the

bone, buffering of acid-base, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy storage and

release. Storage forms of high concentration of phosphorus are seen in the bones.

Phosphorus is absorbed in the diet and excreted by the kidneys.

**NORMAL RANGE**

1\.8 – 2.6 mEq/L (2.7 to 4.5 mg/dL)

**INDICATIONS**

Phosphate level measurement is useful in diagnosing and management of bone,

renal disease, parathyroid disorders and a variety of other disorders.

**INTERPRETATION**

Serum phosphate levels of 1.5-2.4 mg/dL shows a moderate decrease.

Serum phosphate levels lower than 1.5 mg/dL cause red cell hemolysis, muscle

weakness, impaired bone growth, and bone deformity.

Serum phosphate levels lower than 1 mg/dL are defined as critical and may be life-

threatening

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Hypocalcemia, rhabdomyolysis, bone metastasis, renal failure, hemolytic anemia,

hypoparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, acidosis, acromegaly, advanced myeloma or

lymphoma, liver disease.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, adult osteomalacia, childhood rickets,

alkalosis, chronic alcoholism, diabetic acidosis, sepsis and malnutrition.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Specific drugs may interfere with the test results of serum phosphorous levels.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

The patient should be informed that fasting may be required for at least 8-12 hours

before the test.

**MAGNESIUM (Mg)**

Magnesium is used to determine the metabolic activity of the body and renal

function. Magnesium is essential for the mechanism of blood clotting. It regulates

neuromuscular activity and also plays the role of a cofactor for many enzymatic

reactions. It is involved in calcium metabolism.

**NORMAL RANGE**

1\.6 to 2.6 mg/dL

**INDICATIONS**

Patients with renal failure or gastrointestinal disorders need to be closely monitored

and diagnosed for hypermagnesia or hypomagnesia. Patients with pre-eclampsia on

magnesium sulfate need to be monitored.

**INTERPRETATION**

Serum magnesium levels of 1.0 mg/dL or lower manifest symptoms.

Serum magnesium levels of 9.0 mg/dL or higher may be critical and life-

threatening.



<a name="br33"></a> 

Renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, ingestion of magnesium-containing antacids

or salt, Addison’s disease, uncontrolled diabetes.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Chronic renal disease, hypoparathyroidism, malnutrition, chronic alcoholism,

diabetic acidosis, malabsorption.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Phytate, fatty acids, and increased phosphate cause impairment in the absorption of

magnesium. Hemolysis causes increased serum magnesium results because the

RBC contains 2-3 times higher amount of magnesium than the serum.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Long-term parenteral nutrition therapy and prolonged use of magnesium

supplements cause increased serum magnesium levels. Decreased serum

magnesium levels are seen in an excessive loss of body fluids.



<a name="br34"></a> 

**RENAL FUNCTION STUDIES**

R

enal function studies assess the kidney function of an individual. The chief

functions of the organ are to regulate the water content and balance of the

body, regulate electrolyte content, regulate the normal acid base equilibrium,

retain various essential substances vital to the body, and excrete the waste products

of metabolism, especially the end products of metabolism, urea and creatinine. The

kidney excretes various organic acids as well as any increased inorganic substances

in the diet and certain foreign substances.

Thus, the kidney has both a regulatory and excretory function. In addition, the

kidney has an endocrine function since several hormones, including renin, help

maintain arterial blood pressure and vascular tone. Erythropoietin which stimulates

erythroid cell proliferation and maturation in bone marrow is secreted into the

bloodstream by the kidney. The kidney is also a site of action of other hormones

secreted elsewhere in the body, including the anti-diuretic hormone secreted by the

posterior pituitary gland.

Also, both insulin and glucagon from the pancreas and aldosterone from the adrenal

cortex are degraded in the kidney such that a conversion of vitamin D into its active

form occurs, causing the retention of calcium by the renal tubules and the

absorption of both calcium and phosphorus from the intestine. Thus, the kidney

participates in bone metabolism.

The primary functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, which includes the

glomerulus through which plasma is filtered. The various tests of renal function are

classified either according to the regulatory, excretory or endocrine function or

whether they measure glomerular filtration, tubular absorption, or tubular secretion.

Acute emergency to chronic settings can be assessed by renal function tests. These

tests are primarily done to diagnose acute renal diseases to provide timely and

appropriate treatment to the patient. Furthermore, renal function tests identify the

stage or type of renal disease and also help in monitoring its prognosis. It is an

important guide to assess the response to intervention.

Creatinine is the most essential value in a renal function test. It is an important

marker of the glomerular filtration rate in blood. Its value in urine can be used as a

quality control tool to assess the accuracy of a 24-hour collection. It may even

remove the need for a 24 hour collection. Creatinine is formed constantly in the

muscles at a steady rate. It is a dehydration product of creatine that cannot be

reversed to creatine once formed. Therefore, the amount of creatinine varies with

ethnicity, age, and gender as it is related to muscle mass and is formed on a daily

basis.

Creatinine is not reabsorbed or secreted by the renal tubules once it is freely filtered

through the glomerulus. The serum concentration of creatinine shows a balance

between production and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The creatinine clearance

rate is an excellent surrogate for the glomerular filtration rate, particularly in

patients whose muscle mass remains the same and GFR is constant.



<a name="br35"></a> 

The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test is routinely obtained as part of a metabolic

panel (basic or comprehensive). It plays an indispensable role in the emergency

states as it gives valuable information about different types of clinical

presentations.

In humans, urea and carbon dioxide are end products of the urea cycle and serve as

alternative sources of energy. The amino acids present in food but not used in

protein synthesis are oxidized and form urea and carbon dioxide.

About 85% of urea is excreted via the kidneys, and the remaining small portion is

excreted via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In acute and chronic renal

failure/impairment, serum urea levels increase as renal clearance is decreased in

these conditions. Upper GI bleeding, dehydration, catabolic states, and high

protein diets not related to renal conditions can also cause increased urea levels.

Starvation and severe liver disease show decreased urea levels. When the BUN is

increased, the ratio of BUN to creatinine can be useful to differentiate pre-renal

from renal causes.

**SERUM CREATININE**

Serum creatinine is the most important indicator of renal function. Increased levels

of creatinine reflect as a slowing of the glomerular filtration rate.

**NORMAL RANGE**

0\.6 to 1.3 mg/dL

**INDICATIONS**

Creatinine value is vital in assessing renal function because it is an accurate

reflection of the GFR. It is a marker of glomerular filtration rate in the blood and

in urine and can be used as a tool of quality assurance to assess the precision of a

24-hour urine sample collection.

**INTERPRETATION**

Low serum creatinine values almost always reflect low muscle mass. Serum

creatinine increases in acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease where there is

a decrease in GFR.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Glomerulonephritis, nephritis, pyelonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, acromegaly,

diabetic nephropathy, rhabdomyolysis, shock, urinary tract obstruction, congestive

heart failure, dehydration.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Muscular dystrophy, debilitation, myasthenia gravis.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Improper blood sampling may interfere with the results. Drugs interfering in

creatinine estimation are ethamsylate, calcium dobesilate, and 5-aminolevulinic

acid.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Patients should avoid excessive and strenuous exercise for 8 hours. Excessive

intake of red meat for 24 hours before the test should be avoided.



<a name="br37"></a> 

**BLOOD UREA NITROGEN (BUN)**

Blood urea nitrogen is a substance formed by an enzymatic breakdown process of

protein and formed in the liver. Urea goes through a free filtration in the renal

glomeruli, with a small amount reabsorbed in the tubules and the remaining amount

is excreted in the urine. Slowing of the glomerular filtration rate leads to elevation

of Blood urea nitrogen.

**NORMAL RANGE**

8 to 25 mg/dL

**INDICATIONS**

BUN testing is asked as a part of a routine test panel. In an emergency setting it

gives valuable information that helps to assess and diagnose various clinical

presentations.

**INTERPRETATION**

If the blood urea nitrogen is elevated it indicates a slowing of glomerular filtration

rate (GFR). The critical value of urea is >100 mg/dL and indicates serious renal

function impairment.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Glomerulonephritis, renal failure, nephrotoxic drugs, pyelonephritis, sepsis,

ureteral obstruction, hypovolemia, myocardial infarction, shock, starvation, burns

and congestive heart failure.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or fluid overload,

nephrotic syndrome, pregnancy, malnutrition.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

A high-protein diet may cause high BUN levels. Medications like steroids and

antibiotics can alter the values. A Low-protein diet may cause low BUN levels.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Red meat intake in excess should be avoided for 24 hours before the test, and

strenuous exercise should be avoided.

GLUCOSE STUDIES

B

lood glucose lab values are the most essential in managing diabetes mellitus.

Blood sugar level is determined by the balance between absorption, storage

and utilization. The body generally keeps the level of blood sugar amazingly

constant despite periods of high absorption, that is, after meals and high utilization

like exercise, fever, etc. There will be some variation, but the body keeps it within a

certain normal range. When food is eaten and the level rises, more glycogen is

made to store the excess sugar. Between meals and during exercise, glycogen is

degraded to keep up blood sugar as glucose disappears from the blood for use in the

tissues.

In diabetes mellitus, there is an upset in the balance of factors controlling the

utilization of glucose. In most of the cases, the cause is a lack of sufficient insulin.

Even in early and mild cases, where the fasting blood glucose is at the upper level

of normal or only very slightly elevated, the rise in blood glucose after a meal is

much more than normal, and it takes a long time for the elevated blood glucose to

return to normal levels.

When the level of blood glucose exceeds 180 mg/dl, the amount filtered into the

glomerular filtrate cannot all be reabsorbed, so the glucose appears in the urine

(glycosuria). The level of blood beneath where no glucose appears in the urine is

called the renal threshold. Normally this threshold is 180 mg/dl to 200 mg/dl. Renal

glycosuria is a condition where the kidney has an unusually low threshold for

glucose, and glucose appears in the urine even when the blood glucose is normal.

Glucose is a primary metabolite for energy production in the body. It is a

monosaccharide. The digestive system breaks up the complex carbohydrates into

the final product of monosaccharides like glucose, fructose or galactose. These

broken down monosaccharides are then absorbed in the small intestine. The

transport of glucose requires a specific transport protein and a simultaneous uptake

of sodium ions into the cells. Glucose is closely regulated by hormones such as

insulin, cortisol, and glucagon in blood circulation. These hormones regulate

glucose entry into cells and impact various metabolic processes such as glycolysis,

gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis. Glucose entry into the cells is mediated by

glucose transporter (GLUT) receptors, a facilitated transport. GLUT-4 receptors are

present in muscle and adipose tissues and require insulin for glucose transport,

indicating their tissue specificity. Glucose is carried across the blood-brain barrier

by a GLUT-1 receptor.

Glycolysis is the main metabolic reaction, using glucose as its substrate.

Glycolysis is used by all tissues for the breakdown of glucose and to generate

adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the principal energy producing molecule. It

also serves as an intermediate for other metabolic pathways. Glycolysis serves as

the core of carbohydrate metabolism.

Glucose tolerance testing (GTT) is indicated when a random or fasting blood

glucose test is insufficient to diagnose or rule out diabetes mellitus. GTT is used to

assess the ability of the body to regulate glucose metabolism. A combination of

carbohydrate uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, peripheral glucose uptake, and



<a name="br39"></a> 

hepatic glucose output is indicated by glucose tolerance test.

The GTT is done on an empty stomach in the morning, and the patient should

remain seated throughout. This test measures the body’s ability to handle a sudden

large dose of glucose, determining both the effect on blood glucose and whether

any glucose appears in the urine. The first sample is fasting glucose testing, after

which the glucose load is administered orally or intravenously and plasma glucose

is measured at specified intervals thereafter. In standard oral GTT, plasma glucose

levels are measured at 2 hours after a 75 g oral glucose load, but for gestational

diabetes mellitus, an additional sample may be measured at 1 hour. The

recommended glucose is a maximum of 75 g, and the dosage for a child is 1.75

g/kg body weight.

A specific fraction of hemoglobin called hemoglobin A1c is found in patients with

diabetes mellitus as well as healthy individuals. It is formed when the valine of N-

terminal of the beta chain of hemoglobin A is modified by the addition of a

component of sugar moiety. Hemoglobin A1c is stable once formed. Hence, the

hemoglobin A1c level shows the average blood glucose for 120 days, which is the

lifespan of a RBC.

It has been studied and shown that maintaining near normal levels of blood glucose

as reflected by HbA1c delays the onset and also slows the progression of diabetic

microvascular complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Even

though finger prick measurement of glucose by patients remains the method of

diabetes management and for adjusting daily insulin, the importance of ongoing,

periodic A1c measurements to monitor compliance and the efficacy of therapy

cannot be undermined.



<a name="br40"></a> 

**FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE**

Fasting blood glucose or sugar (FBS) levels are primary tests used to diagnose

diabetes mellitus and hypoglycemia. Glucose is the main source of cellular energy

for the body and is essential for brain and RBC function.

**NORMAL RANGE**

Glucose, fasting: 70 – 110 mg/dL; Glucose, 2-hr postprandial: < 140mg/dL

**INDICATIONS**

Blood glucose levels are tightly regulated in a narrow range by a complex

mechanism by several hormones. Hence, a derangement of variation of blood

glucose is often a hint of illness.

**INTERPRETATION**

Values for diabetes mellitus:

• Fasting plasma glucose value of greater than 125 mg/dL

• Random plasma glucose more than 200 mg/dL, postprandial glucose at 2

hours >200 mg/dL

• Hypoglycemia is a blood glucose level < 70 mg/dL.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy, Cushing’s Syndrome, diuretic therapy,

glucagonoma, pheochromocytoma, acute stress response.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Insulinoma, extensive liver disease, hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, insulin

overdose, starvation.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Increased coagulation factor levels, the body’s ability to produce and respond to

insulin.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Fasting state of the patient for 8 to 12 hours is required before the test. The patients

should withhold morning insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication if they are

diabetic until the blood is drawn.



<a name="br41"></a> 

**GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (GTT)**

The glucose tolerance test (GTT) helps in the diagnosing diabetes mellitus. After

injection or ingestion of glucose, If the glucose levels peak at higher than normal at

1 and 2 hours after and are slower than normal to return to fasting levels, a

diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is confirmed.

**NORMAL LABVALUES FOR GTT**

70 – 110 mg/dL (baseline fasting)

110 – 170 mg/dL (30 minute fasting)

120 – 170 mg/dL (60 minute fasting)

100 – 140 mg/dL (90 minute fasting)

70 – 120 mg/dL (120 minute fasting)

**INDICATIONS**

Oral GTT is indicated when the fasting or random blood glucose levels are

suggestive toward the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, for screening of

impaired glucose tolerance, and to screen for gestational diabetes.

**INTERPRETATION**

Patients who present with a higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus, with a view

to beginning preventive therapy, need a glucose tolerance test.

**ABNORMAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST**

Diabetes mellitus, glucagonoma, pheochromocytoma, corticosteroid therapy,

Cushing’s Syndrome, diuretic therapy, acute stress response.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Increased coagulation factor levels interfere with the glucose tolerance test results.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

The patient should eat a carbohydrate-rich diet for 3 days before the test. Inform the

patient to fast for 10 to 16 hours before the test. Patients with diabetes mellitus

should withhold insulin or hypoglycemic medications. The patient should be

informed that the procedure of the test may take 3 to 5 hours, require administration

of glucose, oral or IV, and collecting of multiple blood samples.



<a name="br42"></a> 

**HBA1C (GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN)**

HbA1c gives the measure of the amount of glucose attached to the

hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a part of the RBC that carries oxygen from the lungs to

the peripheral organs. As the average lifespan of the RBC is about 3 months, the

HbA1c gives a measure of the glucose levels over the past three months.

**RESULTS**

Normal range: less than 5.7%

Pre-diabetes: between 5.7%-6.5%

Diabetes : more than 6.5%

**INDICATIONS**

Diabetic symptoms: increased thirst, increased hunger, increased urination, fatigue,

blurred vision. Higher risk of diabetes: severe hypertension, diabetes, obesity,

sedentary lifestyle.

**INTERPRETATION**

HbA1c in the range of 4% to 5.6% indicates no diabetes.

HbA1c of 5.7% to 6.5% indicates a higher risk for diabetes mellitus.

HbA1c of greater than 6.5% indicates a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

**ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS ANALYSIS**

T

he branching of the systemic arteries is like a tree in which the common trunk

is the aorta that starts in the left ventricle while the smallest branches are

capillaries that extend into the peripheral tissues of the body organs.

Oxygenated blood is carried away from the heart to the peripheral tissues by large

blood vessels called arteries.

Metabolism is the consumption of nutrients and release of acid metabolites. The

accumulation of these acid metabolites should be prevented because major

functions of the body like myocardial contractility and nervous system

electrophysiology depend on an environment where a narrow range of free

hydrogen ion concentration is present. The degree of free hydrogen ion

concentration is the pH. If the normal ranges of pH deviate significantly and occur

over short intervals, it could be life threatening. Thus, maintenance of the biologic

system requires an exact acid base balance.

Almost 98% of metabolites are in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide

readily reacts with water to form carbonic acid, a substance that can reversibly exist

in either a liquid or gaseous state. Since carbonic acid can be readily transformed

into carbon dioxide, excretion of the normal metabolites can be achieved by the

lungs (respiratory acid - base balance).

The normal gastrointestinal absorptive process provides nutrients whose

metabolism results in approximately 1% to 2% of the acid load being organic and

inorganic nonvolatile acids. All pathological metabolites are nonvolatile acids, and

they cannot be excreted by the lungs. The mechanisms that provide for the

buffering and accretion of nonvolatile acid metabolites is called metabolic acid

base balance.

An arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling is done by direct puncture in the artery and

is a procedure often practiced in the hospital emergency room and wards. Arterial

blood sampling involves the violation of a blood vessel and hence caution should

be exercised in three significant areas: bleeding, vessel obstruction and infection.

Blood gas analysis uses an arterial sample because only the right and left ventricles

contain thoroughly mixed blood that has returned from the capillary beds, where

respiration has occurred.

Arteries are vessels in which virtually no gas exchange occurs; hence, the arterial

sample is assumed to have the same pH, Po2 and Pco2 as the ventricle. The criteria

to choose the site for an arterial sample should be based on safety, accessibility and

patient comfort. The best site is the radial artery on the wrist because it is

superficial in location, easy to palpate and stabilize, collateral circulation via the

ulnar artery is excellent, the probing needle can be relatively pain free if the

surrounding periosteum is avoided, and the artery is not adjacent to any major vein.



<a name="br45"></a> 

When the radial artery is the dominant blood supply to the palmar arch, the ulnar

artery may be chosen as the puncture site. The ulnar artery is not the wrist artery of

choice as it is difficult to stabilize and is more readily subjected to thrombosis,

given its smaller diameter. The brachial artery in the antecubital fossa is an

alternative choice when radial arteries are unavailable. It does have a few risks and,

therefore, it is best done by the physicians. Non-physicians should be limited to

radial arteries. Percutaneous cannulation of the dorsalis pedis artery is reliable,

easily performed, and relatively safe. The femoral artery has been used in intensive

care units for a long time without significant problems. If there is ischemia of the

foot, it is an indication to remove the catheter immediately.

The ease of doing the procedure at the patient’s bedside, the low incidence of major

complications, and its rapid diagnostic yield make it an invaluable test to decide

patient treatment by the medical personnel. It has very high value, especially in

critically ill patients, to determine the exchange of gas in the blood.

ABG gives a lot of information on the acid-base balance in seriously ill patients.

The determination of ventilation success is provided by the measure of CO2

content in ABG. Accurate determination of the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient

(A-a gradient) is only possible by ABG.

ABG results are indicative of the patient's condition at a specific point in time, and

the clinical correlation should be done carefully as the clinical scenario progresses

over time. The arterial blood gas test is indicated in assessment of respiratory,

metabolic, and mixed acid-base disorders, which may or may not have physiologic

compensation. In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) on insulin infusion,

ABG helps in monitoring the acid base status. ABG and venous blood gas (VBG)

could be obtained simultaneously for comparison.

Response to therapeutic interventions can be monitored in patients on mechanical

ventilation in respiratory failure. ABG aids in the assessment of the requirement for

home oxygen therapy in patients with advanced chronic pulmonary disease. It also

helps in the quantification of oxyhemoglobin and the quantification of the levels of

carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin.

An ABG sampling is absolutely contraindicated if there is a local infection at the

sample drawing site or distorted anatomy from congenital or acquired

malformations, surgical interventions, or burns. Arteriovenous fistulas and severe

peripheral vascular disease of the limb involved are also contraindications for the

same. Severe coagulopathy, therapy with Warfarin, heparin and other

anticoagulants, and the use of thrombolytic agents are relative contraindications.



<a name="br46"></a> 

**ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS (ABG)**

Arterial blood gases (ABGs) measure the extent of compensation by the buffer

system. It gives a measure of pH and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in

arterial blood. Blood sampling is usually done from the veins, except for an ABG

test where the blood is taken from an artery.

**NORMALVALUES**

pH: 7.35 – 7.45, PaO2: 80 – 100 mmHg, SaO2: >95, PCO2: 35 – 45 mmHg,

HCO3: 22 – 26 mEq/L

**INDICATIONS**

ABG is a rapid test done to decide and direct the treatment for critically ill patients

and to determine gas exchange levels in the blood as related to the respiratory

system, metabolic system, and renal function.

**INTERPRETATION**

The ABG test gives specific information about the acid-base balance and gas

exchange levels in arterial blood at specific time. It is the only way to measure the

alveolar arterial gradient in the lungs. Monitoring the treatment response in

mechanical ventilation.

<a name="br48"></a> 

**LIVER FUNCTION TESTS**

L

iver function blood tests are used to aid the diagnosis of liver diseases and to

monitor liver damage. There are many different functions of the liver, and

many different tests have been devised to measure liver function. Liver

function tests are divided according to the function of the liver they measure. The

major pigment in the body is the heme part of hemoglobin. When red blood cells

die, the hemoglobin is liberated and the heme is separated from globin. The iron

atom is removed and the porphyrin ring opened, converting the heme to biliverdin

and then to bilirubin.

This bilirubin though closely bound to albumin is known as free bilirubin and is

normally present in plasma or serum in very small quantities. In the liver, this free

bilirubin is taken up by the hepatic cells and combined with glucuronic acid to form

conjugated bilirubin. A small amount of conjugated bilirubin gets into the blood

and can be detected in the serum; most of it is excreted in bile. Conjugated bilirubin

is not bound to protein, and it can therefore pass through the glomerulus and appear

in the urine.

Free bilirubin is poorly soluble in water whereas conjugated bilirubin is very

soluble. This difference in solubility of the two forms of bilirubin allows us to

distinguish between the two in the chemical procedure used to measure bilirubin in

the serum. Bilirubin in the bile is reduced by bacteria in the intestine to form

urobilinogen (stercobilinogen). The greater part of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed

and carried back to the liver (enterohepatic circulation) and re-excreted in the bile,

although a small amount escapes into the systemic circulation. The urobilinogen in

the feces is oxidized to urobilin (stercobilin). These substances together make up

the bile pigments.

The liver is very much a part of the metabolism of lipids. This includes synthesis,

esterification (turning lipids into soluble salts), and the storage and excretion of

cholesterol. The liver also plays a very important role in the metabolism of

carbohydrates by the formation and storage of glycogen while it helps the

breakdown of glycogen to maintain blood glucose level and the supply of glucose

to cells throughout the body. The liver is also involved in protein metabolism both

through the synthesis of many proteins by the hepatic cells like albumin,

prothrombin, fibrinogen, and many coagulation factors and also by the synthesis of

urea as the final product of protein metabolism. There are a number of enzymes

present in serum found in greater levels when there is damage to hepatic cells or

obstruction of bile excretion.

Certain enzymes and proteins in the blood like alanine aminotransferase, aspartate

aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, ammonia, amylase, lipase, protein, and lipids

are measured by these tests. Liver function tests are also done to monitor the

normal functions of the liver like the production of protein and bilirubin clearance,

a waste product of the blood. Some enzymes are released by the liver cells in

response to damage or disease. Deranged levels can indicate liver diseases.

Liver function tests include:



<a name="br49"></a> 

Alanine transaminase (ALT) is an enzyme that converts proteins into energy for the

liver cells. It was earlier called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). A

low level of ALT is normally present in the serum. Liver damage increases alanine

transaminase, and ALT is also used to screen and monitor liver disease.

Aspartate transaminase (AST) is an enzyme that metabolizes amino acids. It was

originally called as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Like ALT,

AST is normally found in blood in small quantities. An elevation in AST levels

may indicate liver damage, disease, or muscle damage. The enzyme is released

when there is damage to these organs or hemolysis, resulting in elevated AST levels

in the serum. Serum levels reflect the extent of damage.

The liver and bone contain alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme important for

protein break down. In the liver, the bile ducts are lined with cells that contain ALP.

Bile ducts are small tubules that drain bile from the liver to the intestine, and the

ALP in these bile ductular cells helps to digest fat in the diet. Higher-than-normal

levels of ALP may suggest bile duct blockage, liver damage or disease, or certain

bone diseases.

Albumin is an important protein of the body and is made in the liver. These

proteins fight infections, and they are needed by the body to perform other

functions like modulation of plasma oncotic pressure while they help in the

transport of ligands like bilirubin, ions, fatty acids and drugs. Decreased levels of

albumin below the normal range may indicate liver damage or disease.

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells. Bilirubin traverses through the

liver and is excreted in the urine and stools. Jaundice is the yellowish discoloration

of the skin due elevated levels of bilirubin that might indicate liver damage or

disease or certain anemias. Bilirubin is a product of the breakdown of heme

catabolism. About 70%-90% of bilirubin is derived from hemoglobin degradation

and from other heme proteins to a smaller extent. Both direct bilirubin (DBil) and

total-value bilirubin (TBil) are measured in the serum.

Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a liver enzyme present in the blood in small

amounts. Elevated levels of GGT may suggest liver or bile duct damage.

L-lactate dehydrogenase (LD) is another one of the panel of enzymes found in the

liver. Higher than normal levels may indicate liver damage but can be elevated in

many other disorders.

Prothrombin time (PT) is the measure of time taken by the blood to clot. Increased

PT may suggest liver damage, but it can also be elevated if patients are on

anticoagulants or blood-thinning drugs, such as Coumadin.



<a name="br50"></a> 

**ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE (ALT)**

The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is used to detect and monitor injury to the

hepatocellular component, inflammation of the liver, and to assess the improvement

or worsening of the disease in response to treatment. ALT was earlier known as

serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT).

**NORMAL RANGES**

Adult male: 10 to 55 units/L ; Female: 7 to 30 units/L

**INDICATIONS**

The ALT test is done when liver disease is suspected and also to monitor the liver

function.

**INTERPRETATION**

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is usually measured concurrently with AST as part

of a liver function panel to determine the cause of organ damage. ALT is a primary

enzyme in the liver that has a longer half-life and is more specific for liver damage,

whereas AST is systemic and found in many other organs.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic ischemia, hepatotoxic drugs, hepatic tumor,

cirrhosis, cholestasis, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, infectious mononucleosis,

myocardial infarction, myositis, severe burns, trauma to striated muscle.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

is expected and normal.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Vitamin B6 depletion can show falsely low AST and ALT levels. Hemolyzed

specimens should not be used for this test.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Patients should be informed that fasting is not required and intramuscular injections

taken previously may cause elevated levels.



<a name="br51"></a> 

**ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (AST)**

The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) test is used to assess and aid in diagnosis of

a patient with a suspected hepatocellular disease, injury, or inflammation. Along

with cardiac markers, it could also be used to evaluate coronary artery occlusive

disease. AST was previously known as serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase

(SGOT).

**NORMAL RANGES**

Adult male: 10 – 40 units/L, Female: 9 – 25 units/L

**INDICATIONS**

The AST test is done simultaneously with ALT when liver disease or damage is

suspected and also to monitor the liver function and response to treatment.

**INTERPRETATION**

Conditions associated with very high aspartate aminotransferase levels are liver

damage in conditions like acute viral hepatitis, acute fulminant hepatitis, tumor

necrosis, toxins/drugs including acetaminophen overdose.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Liver diseases: drug-induced liver injury, hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, hepatic

cirrhosis, hepatic metastasis, hepatic surgery, heart diseases, cardiac operations,

myocardial infarctions, cardiac catheterization and angioplasty,

skeletal muscle diseases: heat stroke, progressive muscular dystrophy, multiple

traumas, primary muscle diseases, recent noncardiac surgery, severe burns, acute

hemolytic anemia, acute pancreatitis.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Chronic renal dialysis, diabetic ketoacidosis, pregnancy, acute renal disease,

beriberi.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

An elevated AST and normal ALT can indicate a normal liver, but damage to other

organs and/or hemolysis because ALT is found in various other organs, Vitamin B6

depletion can result in falsely low AST and ALT levels. Hemolyzed specimens

should not be used.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Instruct the patient that fasting is not required. Elevated levels can be seen due to

previous intramuscular injections.




<a name="br52"></a> 

**BILIRUBIN**

Bilirubin is formed by the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and is a breakdown

product of hemoglobin. Total bilirubin levels are further broken into direct bilirubin

and indirect bilirubin. Any type of jaundice can increase the total bilirubin level. The

values of direct and indirect bilirubin levels help differentiate the various causes of

jaundice.

**NORMAL RANGES**

Bilirubin Total: 0.3 – 1.0 mg/dL, Direct bilirubin: 0.0 to 0.2 mg/dL, Indirect

bilirubin: 0.1 to 1 mg/dL, critical level: > 12 mg/dL

**INDICATIONS**

The bilirubin test is done in suspected liver disease and also to monitor the liver

function.

**INTERPRETATION**

Higher than normal levels of bilirubin indicate liver damage. Elevated direct

bilirubin indicates that the liver is not clearing the bilirubin properly.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Extrahepatic duct obstruction (inflammation, scarring, surgical trauma, or tumor),

cholestasis from drugs, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, extensive liver metastasis,

gallstones, Rotor’s Syndrome.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Erythroblastosis fetalis, Gilbert’s Syndrome, cirrhosis, Crigler-Najjar Syndrome,

hemolytic jaundice, hepatitis, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, hematoma, pernicious

anemia, sepsis, transfusion reaction.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

The results will be elevated with the ingestion of alcohol or the administration of

theophylline, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), morphine sulfate, or acetylsalicylic acid

(aspirin).

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

The patient should be told to eat a diet low in yellow foods, avoiding foods such as

carrots, yellow beans, and pumpkin for 3 to 4 days before the blood is drawn. The

test requires fasting for 4 hours before the blood sample is drawn. If the patient has

received a radioactive scan within 24 hours prior to the test, the results are invalid.

**ALBUMIN**

Albumin is the most important protein of the blood that regulates plasma oncotic

pressure and transports ligands endogenous ligands like bilirubin, fatty acids,

hormones and exogenous ligands like drugs and other substances that are insoluble

in water.

**NORMAL RANGE**

3\.4 to 5 g/dL

**INDICATIONS**

Albumin is decreased in conditions such as acute infection, ascites, and alcoholism

and increased in conditions such as dehydration, diarrhea, and metastatic carcinoma.

If albumin, or protein, is detected in the urine it is indicative of abnormal renal

function.

**INTERPRETATION**



<a name="br53"></a> 

Dehydration, severe diarrhea, severe vomiting.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Acute liver failure, increased capillary permeability, malnutrition,

pregnancy,

cirrhosis, familial idiopathic dysproteinemia protein-losing

enteropathies, protein-losing nephropathies, inflammatory disease,

severe burns, severe malnutrition, ulcerative colitis.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Anabolic steroids, androgens, growth hormones and insulin interfere with the

measurement of albumin. Marked lipemia can interfere with albumin measurement.

Albumin is decreased in the third trimester of pregnancy; Large amounts of

intravenous fluids may give inaccurate results.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

No fasting is indicated




<a name="br54"></a> 

**AMMONIA**

Ammonia is formed as a by-product of protein catabolism. It is generated in the gut

by the action of proteins on the bacteria normally present. Metabolism of ammonia

takes place in the liver and is excreted by the kidneys as urea. When there is hepatic

dysfunction, elevated levels of ammonia may lead to encephalopathy.

**NORMAL RANGE**

Adults: 35 – 65 mcg/dL

**INDICATIONS**

This test is used to confirm a diagnosis of Reye Syndrome or hepatic

encephalopathy caused by liver disease which results in changes in behavior and

consciousness, to investigate the cause of coma of unexplainable origin, and to

evaluate a urea cycle defect.

**INTERPRETATION**

Increased ammonia in circulation causes hyperbilirubinemia by inhibiting cell

growth, causing apoptosis and damages the mitochondria of the hepatocytes.

Therefore, energy synthesis is reduced, which in turn reduces the expression of

enzymes associated with bilirubin metabolism.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Reye Syndrome, Liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatic coma, Inherited urea cycle defect,

hemolytic disease in infants (erythroblastosis fetalis), renal disease, certain inborn

errors of metabolism of urea Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Hyperornithinemia, hypothyroidism, essential or malignant hypertension, Use of

certain antibiotics (e.g. neomycin).

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

High glucose levels, hemolysis. Smoking is toxic and increases ammonia levels.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

The patient should fast except for water. The patient should avoid smoking for 8 to

10 hours before the test. The sample should not be hemolyzed. The specimen

should be sent promptly to the laboratory for analysis. High glucose levels over 500

mg/dL may interfere with the test.



<a name="br55"></a> 

**AMYLASE**

Amylase is one of the enzymes produced by the pancreas and salivary glands.

These enzymes help in the breakdown and digestion of complex carbohydrates and

are excreted by the kidneys. They convert starch into maltose, and further enzymes

in the small intestine convert them into monosaccharides.

**NORMAL RANGES**

25 to 151 units/L

**INDICATIONS**

Amylase is measured in conjunction with a lipase test to diagnose acute pancreatitis

and to monitor other pancreatic disorders.

**INTERPRETATION**

Acute pancreatitis is an emergency and comes with intense pain where the amylase

level may exceed five times the normal value. It starts increasing in 6 hours after

the onset of pain, peaks at about 24 hours, and takes 2 to 3 days to return to normal

after the onset of pain. In chronic pancreatitis, the serum amylase level increases

but not more than three times the normal value.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, parotitis, peptic ulcer, duodenal obstruction,

diabetic ketoacidosis, ectopic pregnancy, necrotic bowel, perforated bowel,

pulmonary infarction.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Chronic pancreatitis, liver disease, cystic fibrosis, preeclampsia

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Drugs containing asparaginase, birth control pills, aspirin.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

On the laboratory form, make a list of the medications that the patient has taken

during the previous 24 hours before the test. If the specimen was obtained after

cholecystography within 72 hours of the procedure where radiopaque dyes are

used, the results are invalidated.



<a name="br56"></a> 

**LIPASE**

Lipase is a pancreatic enzyme that converts fats and triglycerides into fatty acids

and glycerol. Pancreatic disorders show elevated lipase levels. Elevations take 24 to

36 hours to occur after the onset of illness and may remain elevated for up to 14

days.

**NORMAL RANGES**

10 to 140 units/L

**INDICATIONS**

The lipase test is done along with amylase in acute pancreatitis. It is also used in

the diagnosis of peritonitis, strangulated or infarcted bowel, and pancreatic cyst.

**INTERPRETATION**

In acute alcoholic pancreatitis, lipase levels remain elevated longer than amylase

and, therefore, its sensitivity is increased. Hence, serum lipase may be a more

reliable indicator than serum amylase for the initial diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Acute pancreatitis, chronic relapsing pancreatitis, extrahepatic duct obstruction,

pancreatic cancer, pancreatic pseudocyst, acute cholecystitis, bowel obstruction or

infarction, cholangitis, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

The presence of hemoglobin, quinine, heavy metals, calcium ions decrease the

lipase levels.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) increases lipase activity.



<a name="br57"></a> 

**SERUM PROTEIN**

Serum protein gives a measure of the total amount of albumin and globulins in the

plasma. Proteins form a major component of blood, skin, hair, nails, and internal

organs.

**NORMAL RANGE**

6 to 8 g/dL

**INDICATIONS**

The patient's overall nutritional status is obtained by the assessment of serum

protein levels, especially if the patient comes with a history of unknown cause of

significant weight loss. This test is also indicated to assess liver disorders, renal

disorders, and bone marrow disorders as part of liver function tests, and to

investigate the cause of edema.

**INTERPRETATION**

Protein is responsible for regulating plasma oncotic pressure and is necessary for

the formation of many hormones, enzymes, and antibodies.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

chronic infection, Crohn’s disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Addison’s disease,

autoimmune

collagen

disorders,

amyloidosis,

dehydration,

human

immunodeficiency virus, multiple myeloma.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

Kidney disorder, liver disease, severe malnutrition, agammaglobulinemia, bleeding,

celiac disease, extensive burns, inflammatory bowel disease.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Drugs like allopurinol, asparaginase, azathioprine, chlorpropamide, cisplatin,

dapsone, dextran, estrogens, ibuprofen, progesterone, acute and chronic

inflammations and decreased liver synthesis, albumin values normally decrease in

third trimester of pregnancy.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Make a list of medications the patient is taking, Inform the patient about the test

procedure. No fluid or food restrictions are required before the procedure.



<a name="br58"></a> 

**LIPID PROFILE**

E

nergy is stored in the body in the form of triglycerides, the most abundant

dietary lipid compound found throughout the diet. The liver is a part of lipid

metabolism which includes formation, esterification to convert lipid into a

soluble salt, storage and the excretion of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a vital

component of a cell membrane and a precursor of the synthesis of bile salts and

steroid hormones. Since the liver is so involved in the metabolism of cholesterol, it

is easy to understand how levels in the serum will vary in liver disease. Where there

is injury or destruction of hepatic cells, as in viral hepatitis, the level of cholesterol

is often decreased. In severe hepatitis and cirrhosis, the level is also often

decreased. But when there is obstruction to the bile flow from the liver, serum

cholesterol may be elevated.

Inherited abnormalities of cholesterol metabolism are rare. Measurement of

cholesterol levels as one gets older is important because high serum cholesterol

levels are indicative of a high risk for cardiovascular disease. Serum cholesterol

levels can usually be lowered by less fat and dairy product consumption in the diet.

Serum cholesterol levels are also found to be elevated in hypothyroidism and

nephrotic syndrome.

Pancreatic lipase digests dietary triglycerides initially. Once the cholecystokinin is

released, bile salts are released in the duodenum in response. Lipid micelles are

formed by bile salts, which form a hydrophobic core of lipid molecules and a

hydrophilic surface, including FFA.

Lipid compounds get absorbed into cells through diffusion into the enterocyte for

biochemical use and also get transported through lipid transporters located on the

luminal side of the enterocyte. After they enter the enterocyte, they form into

triglycerides and are packaged by the Golgi apparatus into chylomicrons to receive

chylomicron specific apolipoproteins, called apo B48, which is a marker for TG

chylomicron. The enterocyte then releases the chylomicrons and enters circulation

by the lymphatic system.

The triglyceride-rich chylomicrons, once in circulation, pass through the

vasculature and undergo protein exchange, a complex process mediated by HDL.

Based on this exchange, they either undergo dilapidation on the vascular

endothelial surface by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or are received in the liver for

further metabolism and packaging. Triglycerides are packaged into very-low dense

lipoprotein (VLDL) for transport to peripheral tissues. In short, they are formed

from triglycerides that undergo hepatic uptake.

Thus, the major carrier of triglycerides and FFA in the serum is VLDL synthesized

within the hepatocyte. A smaller percentage of FFA is complexed to albumin for

transport and travels in an unesterified form. After the VLDL is released into

serum, it traverses to the peripheral tissues where it undergoes a dilapidation

cascade, and the triglyceride is removed by LPL at LPL receptor sites along the

endothelium. After the process of dilapidation, a VLDL remnant (IDL) is formed by

shedding the bulk of the triglyceride and is cleared by the liver or transformed to

LDL by a serum protein exchange process.



<a name="br59"></a> 

The major high-energy compound is the triglyceride, which stores energy and

supplies 9 Kcal/g of free fatty acid. Triglycerides and FFA have a major role in the

etiopathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease formation. Elevated levels of

atherogenic lipoproteins use high triglycerides that contain triglyceride and FFA as

a marker. Elevated triglycerides also indicate insulin resistance in the presence of

low levels of HDL and elevated LDL. Patients with this lipid profile are at a high

risk for coronary heart disease. A major clinical risk factor for coronary artery

disease (CAD) is hypercholesterolemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia, especially

when the HDL levels are low.



<a name="br60"></a> 

**LIPOPROTEIN PROFILE**

A lipoprotein assessment or lipid profile includes total cholesterol, high-density

lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides.

Cholesterol is a major component of LDL that is present in all body tissues, cell

membranes, brain, nerve cells, and some gallstones.

Triglycerides constitute a small part of LDLs and a major part of very-low-density

lipoproteins (VLDL). Increased triglyceride levels, cholesterol levels and LDL

levels put the patient at a high risk for coronary artery disease. High LDL increases

the risk and high HDL protects against the risk of coronary artery disease.

**NORMAL RANGES**

Cholesterol < 200 mg/dL, Triglycerides < 150 mg/dL, HDLs: 30 to 70 mg/dL,

LDLs < 130 mg/dL

**INDICATIONS**

Both men and women are at an equally increased risk for coronary artery disease.

Males aged 35 years and older and females aged 45 years and older should undergo

lipid profile screening. Screening of blood cholesterol levels in children and

adolescents is recommended for children in families where familial dyslipidemias

and premature heart ailments has been established.

**INTERPRETATION**

Normal values of triglycerides (TG) should be less than 150mg/dL. Elevated

triglycerides are serum blood values being greater than 149mg/dL.Very high serum

levels of triglycerides of more than 500mg/dL can cause development of acute

pancreatitis.

**INCREASED HDL LEVELS**

Familial HDL lipoproteinemia, extensive exercise.

**DECREASED HDL LEVELS**

Familial low HDL, hypoproteinemia in malnutrition or nephrotic syndrome,

hepatocellular disease like cirrhosis or hepatitis, metabolic syndrome.

**INCREASED LDL AND VLDL LEVELS**

Familial hypercholesterolemia type IIa, familial LDL lipoproteinemia,

gammopathies like multiple myeloma, alcohol consumption, apoprotein CII

deficiency, chronic liver disease, Cushing’s Syndrome, glycogen storage diseases

like von Gierke’s disease, hepatoma, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome.

**DECREASED LDL AND VLDL LEVELS**

Hypoproteinemia in severe burns, malnutrition or malabsorption, familial

hypolipoproteinemia, hyperthyroidism.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Patients who have consumed a meal rich in lipid compounds and have not fasted

for 8 hours prior to venipuncture can show false positive high-triglyceride levels in

the screening lipid panels. Alcoholics can show elevated triglycerides in the serum.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Oral contraceptives may increase the lipid level, patients should fast and avoid

foods and fluids, except water, for 12 to 14 hours. Patients should not consume

alcohol for 24 hours before the test. Patients should not eat high-cholesterol foods

with dinner before the morning sample is drawn for the test.




<a name="br61"></a> 

**CARDIAC MARKERS AND SERUM ENZYMES**

C

ardiac markers and enzymes are intracellular components that can be

measured in the serum under certain circumstances like trauma, myocardial

ischemia, and myocarditis. Myocardial injury causes a release of serum

enzymes and cardiac markers into circulation as seen in myocardial infarction (MI)

or other diseases of the heart, such as heart failure.

In suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cardiac markers and enzymes are

used in the diagnosis and stratification of risk in patients with chest pain. Cardiac

troponins are the first choice of cardiac markers in patients with ACS.

The guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American

College of Cardiology (ACC) have made cardiac troponin central to the definition

of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac troponins have superior sensitivity and

accuracy; and the guidelines recommend that cardiac biomarkers should be

measured at presentation in patients with suspected MI. It is the only biomarker

recommended for diagnosis in myocardial infarction. Acute MI shows an early

elevated troponin level within 2-3 hours of hospital arrival in 80% of cases,

whereas CK-MB and other cardiac markers are elevated at 6-9 hours or more.

Moreover, with atypical presentations, serum cardiac enzymes can become the only

correct method of identifying problems.

For diagnosis of patients who present with ischemic chest pain and diagnostic ST-

segment elevation in the electrocardiogram, evaluation of cardiac markers is not

required. These patients may need to undergo thrombolytic therapy or primary

angioplasty. Since the sensitivity of cardiac markers is low in the first 6 hours after

the onset of symptoms, treatment should not be delayed by waiting for cardiac

marker results. Immediate reperfusion therapy for patients with ST-segment

elevation MI (STEMI), without waiting for cardiac marker results, is recommended

by the American Heart Association (AHA).

Troponins are found in skeletal and cardiac muscle; they are regulatory proteins

Three subunits of troponin have been identified: troponin I (TnI), troponin T (TnT),

and troponin C (TnC). The skeletal and cardiac subforms for TnI and troponin TnT

are very specific and distinct; and various immunoassays have been made to

differentiate them.

Earlier, the biochemical marker of choice for the diagnosis of acute MI was the CK-

MB isoenzyme before the recommendation for troponins came in. Two serial

elevations of CK-MB above the diagnostic cutoff level or a single elevated result

twice the value of the upper limit was considered the diagnostic criteria for acute

MI. Although the CK-MB is concentrated in the heart muscle, CK-MB also exists

in skeletal muscle, resulting in a number of false-positive elevations in many

clinical settings, including myopathy, trauma and heavy exertion.

CK-MB first appears in the serum 4-6 hours after the onset of symptoms and peaks

at 24 hours. It then returns to normal in 48-72 hours. One of the earliest markers of

MI is myoglobin, a heme protein found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. It has

attracted considerable repute as an early marker of MI. Its early release profile is



<a name="br62"></a> 

attributed to its low molecular weight, and it typically elevates within 2-4 hours

after onset of infarction, then peaks at 6-12 hours before returning to normal within

24-36 hours.

Rapid myoglobin assays have become available, but they lack cardio specificity.

Therefore, serial sampling is recommended every 1-2 hours which increases

sensitivity and specificity. An increase of 25-40% over 1-2 hours is strongly

suggestive of acute MI. According to many studies, myoglobin only achieved 90%

sensitivity for acute MI , so the negative predictive value of myoglobin is not high

enough, and it cannot exclude the diagnosis of acute MI.




<a name="br63"></a> 

**CREATININE KINASE**

The enzyme creatine kinase (CK) is found in heart, muscle, and brain tissue that

reflects tissue catabolism resulting from cell trauma. The creatinine kinase level

begins to increase within 6 hours of damage to the muscle and reaches the peak at

18 hours before returning to normal in 2 to 3 days.

**NORMAL LABVALUES OF CREATININE KINASE AND ISOENZYMES**

Creatinine kinase (CK):

Women: 26 – 140 U/L

Men: 38 – 174 U/L, isoenzymes of creatinine kinase: CK-MM: 95% – 100% of

total, CK-MB: 0% – 5% of total, CK-BB: 0%

**INDICATIONS**

The test for CK is done to assess myocardial damage and central nervous system

damage or skeletal muscle damage. Isoenzymes of creatinine kinase include CK-

MB (cardiac muscle), CK-BB (brain), and CK-MM (muscles):

• CK-MM is found in skeletal muscle mainly.

• CK-MB is found mainly in cardiac muscle.

• CK-BB is found in brain tissue.

**INTERPRETATION**

Increased creatinine kinase is commonly used to aid the diagnosis of acute

myocardial infarction and neuromuscular diseases. Neuromuscular disorders which

show elevated CK enzymes are myopathies, rhabdomyolysis, malignant

hyperthermia, muscular dystrophy, drug-induced myopathies, neuroleptic

malignant syndrome, and periodic paralyses.

**INCREASED LEVELS OF CPK-BB ISOENZYME**

Adenocarcinoma of breast and lungs, central nervous system diseases, pulmonary

infarction.

**INCREASED LEVELS OF CPK -MB ISOENZYME**

Acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, cardiac aneurysm surgery, cardiac

defibrillation, cardiac ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias.

**INCREASED LEVELS OF CPK -MM ISOENZYME**

Muscular dystrophy, myositis, crush injuries, malignant hyperthermia, recent

convulsions, recent surgery, delirium tremens, electroconvulsive therapy,

electromyography, hypokalemia, hypothyroidism, IM injections, rhabdomyolysis,

shock, trauma.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Intramuscular injections and invasive procedures may falsely elevate CK levels.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Strenuous physical activity should be avoided by the patient for 24 hours prior to

the test if it is for skeletal muscle. The patient should also avoid ingestion of

alcohol for 24 hours prior to the test.



<a name="br64"></a> 

**MYOGLOBIN**

A protein called myoglobin is found in the striated (cardiac and skeletal) muscle. It

binds to oxygen and releases oxygen at very low tensions. Myoglobin is released

into the blood whenever there is injury to the skeletal muscle. Myoglobin rises 2-4

hours after an MI; hence it is used as an early marker for determining cardiac

damage.

**NORMAL RANGES**

5–70 ng/mL

**INDICATIONS**

Early myocardial infarction shows a rise in the myoglobin as early as 2-4 hours. it

is also elevated following muscle injury and in inflammatory and degenerative

muscle diseases.

**INTERPRETATION**

Serum myoglobin levels show a rise within two to three hours following a

myocardial infarction. These levels reach their highest values within 8 to 12 hours.

Myoglobin levels return to normal levels within 24 hours.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis, skeletal muscle ischemia, skeletal muscle

trauma, myositis, malignant hyperthermia, muscular dystrophy.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

A recent angina attack may show increased myoglobin levels. Increased myoglobin

levels are also seen in cardioversion, kidney disease, heavy alcohol consumption

and the use of certain drugs.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

The myoglobin level can increase within 2 hours after a myocardial infarction, and

shows a rapid fall in the level after 7 hours. As the myoglobin level gets elevated in

skeletal muscle conditions, it is not cardiac specific. It also rises and falls rapidly,

making its use limited in diagnosing myocardial infarction.



<a name="br65"></a> 

**TROPONIN I AND TROPONIN T**

Troponin is a regulatory protein found in myocardial and skeletal striated muscle.

When an infarction results in damage to the myocardium, increased amounts of

troponin are released into the bloodstream.

**NORMAL RANGES**

Troponin: Lesser than 0.04 ng/mL; value above 0.40 ng/mL indicates myocardial

infarction

Troponin I: Lesser than 0.6 ng/mL; value above1.5 ng/mL is indicative of

myocardial infarction

Troponin T: More than 0.1 to 0.2 ng/mL is indicative of myocardial infarction

**INDICATIONS**

Troponins are the most important enzymes released in response to myocardial

injury, regardless of the cause. Myocardial ischemia leading to infarction is the

most common cause of cardiac muscle damage. Serial measurements of troponin

are recommended to compare with baseline test results. Troponin enzyme

elevations are specific and clinically significant in the diagnosis of heart pathology.

**INTERPRETATION**

Troponin levels begin to rise as early as 3 hours after MI. Troponin I levels may

remain elevated for 7 to 10 days and troponin T levels may remain elevated for

about 10 to 14 days.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiac contusion/trauma,

myocardial injury, endocarditis, cardiac surgery, pulmonary embolism, aortic

dissection.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

Drugs with cardiotoxic properties may also elevate troponins. Most commonly,

they are chemicals such as carbon monoxide and chemotherapeutic drugs such as

cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines, and bevacizumab.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Change venipuncture sites. Serial testing is advised and repeated in 12 hours or as

prescribed. It is then followed by daily testing for 3 to 5 days.

**NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES**

Natriuretic peptides are neuroendocrine peptides used as markers for patients in

heart failure. There are three major peptides:

• Atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) synthesized in cardiac atrial muscle

• Brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) synthesized in the cardiac ventricular

muscle

• C-type natriuretic peptides (CNP) synthesized by endothelial cells

**NORMAL RANGES**

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP): 22 to 27 pg/mL; brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)

less than 100 pg/mL; C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).

Results should be reviewed with the reference range provided.

**INDICATIONS**

To identify heart failure as the cause of dyspnea, the BNP is used as the primary

marker. The higher the BNP level, the more severe the heart failure. If the BNP is

normal, the dyspnea is due to a pulmonary problem; and if the BNP level is

elevated, dyspnea is due to heart failure.

**INTERPRETATION**

In an acutely dyspneic patient, a BNP value of < 100 pg/mL makes the diagnosis of

congestive heart failure less likely. Elevated levels of natriuretic peptides are

indicative of poor long term prognosis in coronary artery disease, congestive heart

failure, and atrial fibrillation.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

Congestive heart failure, cor pulmonale, heart transplant rejection, myocardial

infarction, systemic hypertension.

**INTERFERING FACTORS**

False low levels: obesity, pulmonary edema. False high levels: females, advancing

age, renal failure.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

There is no necessity of fasting for this test.

**HIV AND AIDS TESTING**

H

uman immunodeficiency virus is blood borne and sexually transmissible. This

virus weakens immunity by attacking the most important cells that defend

against viruses. The route of transmission is by sexual intercourse, shared

intravenous drug syringes and other material, and vertical transmission from a

mother-to-child (MTCT), which can occur during delivery or during breastfeeding.

The body fluids that transmit this disease are semen, saliva, blood, vaginal fluids,

rectal fluids, and breastmilk.

The transmission route is different in various populations and depends on the

introduction of the virus initially and also local practices. Other viruses transmitted

by similar routes are hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human herpesvirus 8, also known as

Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus [KSHV]). These viruses can cause a coinfection in HIV

infected patients.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 are the two distinct types HIV; each is composed of several

subtypes. HIV-1 and HIV-2 appear similar, but they are made of unique genes and

have their own process of replication.

The CDC guidelines recommend that everyone between the age of 13 and 64 get

tested as a part of routine health care. Getting tested early in the disease and taking

medications reduces the viral load of HIV effectively and increases expected

survival.

The HIV-2 virus carries a lesser risk of transmission and progresses more slowly to

acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The viral load in HIV-2 is less than

people with HIV-1, where the viral load is higher, and there is rapid progression to

AIDS in HIV-1 infections.

A lot of negative attitudes or stigmas have been attached to HIV infection, mostly

because of the sexually transmitted route of the virus and the inference of sexual

promiscuity. There is also prejudice that an infected individual or group is socially

unacceptable. This stigma has led to reluctance to be tested for HIV infection and

also disrupts the emotional well-being and mental health of the individual. It has

resulted in the refusal to have casual contact with HIV infected individuals. The HIV

virus is not transmitted by casual contact and is inactivated by use of simple

detergents. The concern with HIV is the continuous decline in the immune system

and the incurability of the infection, leading to premature death in the majority of

infected people.

Common tests used to look for the presence of antibodies to HIV include ELISA,

immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot, which assess the nucleic acids,

antigen/antibody or antibody tests. A single reactive ELISA test is not enough to

diagnose HIV and should be repeated with the same blood sample. If the test is

reactive again, follow-up tests should be done with Western blot or IFA. HIV is

confirmed by a positive Western blot or IFA result. If the treatment is started

immediately after the patient is diagnosed with HIV, it reduces the viral load and

helps reduce the progression of the disease and protects the immune system.

If the viral load is not detectable in the blood due to antiretroviral therapy in HIV, the



<a name="br68"></a> 

risk of transmission is reduced drastically. Being HIV positive doesn't mean that the

patient has AIDS. If a person diagnosed with HIV takes treatment as prescribed, the

patient may stay healthy for many years and may not be diagnosed with AIDS at all.




<a name="br69"></a> 

**CD4+ T CELL COUNTS**

The pathogenesis of HIV is largely because of the decline in CD4+ T-cell counts,

and it helps to monitor the progression of HIV. The decrease in immunity is also

attributed to the reduction in CD4+ count. CD4+ T-cell counts higher than 500

cells/L are required to maintain a healthy immune system. When the CD4+ T-cell

count is between 200 and 499 cells/L, it causes immune related problems while

severe immune system problems occur when the CD4+ T-cell count is lesser than

200 cells/L.

**NORMAL RANGES**

Normal: 500 to 1600 cells/L

Severe: Less than 200 cells/L

CD4-to-CD8 ratio: 2:1

**INDICATIONS**

HIV attacks the CD4 cells responsible for immunity. If the CD4 cell count is low,

the immune system of the body cannot fight and defend against infections. The

range of CD4+ T cell count helps to identify the risk of complications in patients

with HIV.

**INTERPRETATION**

CD4+ cell baseline counts have to be measured in patients with HIV every 3 to 6

months during the first 2 years. The CD4 count should be measured till it increases

above 300 cells/mm3.

**INCREASED LEVELS**

T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

**DECREASED LEVELS**

HIV-positive patients, organ transplants, congenital immunodeficiency.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

Fasting is not required before the test.



<a name="br70"></a> 

**THYROID STUDIES**

L

aboratory tests such as thyroxine, T3, T4, and TSH assess thyroid function.

Thyroid studies are evaluated if a disorder is suspected. The function of

thyroid is crucial for the normal development of the fetus and to maintain a

normal metabolic function. Serum levels of thyroid hormones are used to assess the

function.

Thyroid abnormalities are commonly due to an abnormal function or growth of the

gland. Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism present with signs and symptoms when

the levels of thyroid hormones are deranged and reflected in the blood level of

these hormones, most specifically TSH. TSH is produced and secreted by the

pituitary gland. TSH levels are the first line of testing in assessing thyroid status,

whether normal (euthyroid), hyperfunctioning (hyperthyroid), or hypofunctioning

(hypothyroid). The pituitary-hypothalamus axis functions on the principle of

negative feedback and controls and regulates the release and production of thyroid

hormones through the thyroid gland.

The release of TSH is further controlled by the negative feedback mechanism of

thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is secreted by the hypothalamus. TSH

release is elevated when hormone levels are low and decreased when thyroid

hormone levels are high.

Primary thyroid disorders, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, result from disease

in the gland itself. They are caused by the absence or deficiency of processing

enzymes or an autoimmune process attacking the cellular architecture of the gland

or processing enzymes. Hyperthyroidism occurs with excess production of thyroid

hormones which results in a hypermetabolic clinical and biochemical state. It is due

to impaired uptake and processing of iodine due to drugs or a deficiency in the

intake of thyroid hormones as in endemic goiter.

The disease and/or dysfunction of the pituitary or hypothalamus, leading to

abnormal stimulation of the thyroid gland, results in secondary hyperthyroidism or

hypothyroidism results. Goiter is the enlargement of the thyroid gland, which may

or may not occur with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

In Hashimoto thyroiditis, thyroid gland enlargement is seen due to TSH stimulation

caused by hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is more frequent in females, showing

increased levels of both T3 and T4. A toxic nodule may cause sole elevation of T3

called T3 toxicosis and is generally seen in elderly individuals.

The symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism include weight loss, increased

sweating, fatigue, insomnia, tremors, palpitations, eye changes, intolerance to heat

and/or light, anxiety, tachycardia, loose motions, oligomenorrhea, infertility, and

osteoporosis. The symptoms of hypothyroidism are dry hair, hair loss, myxedema,

mucosal thickening causing hoarse voice, psychomotor retardation and the opposite

of signs and the symptoms of hyperthyroidism mentioned above.

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most common method for

the estimation of T3 .



<a name="br71"></a>

Thyroid studies are done to identify primary thyroid disease and differentiate them

from secondary causes. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies detect autoimmune

conditions of the thyroid gland.

<a name="br73"></a> 

**URINE ANALYSIS**

A

urine analysis is conducted for numerous reasons. Urine is one of the most

easily obtainable specimens that is analyzed in the lab. The examination of

urine provides information about the functioning of the kidneys and

abnormalities of the urinary tract. It may also lead to a diagnosis of many systemic

illnesses of the body reflected by the presence of various substances in the urine. It

is most commonly done when clinicians suspect an infection in the urinary tract

and to evaluate for kidney and metabolic disorders. The test is done for both

screening and diagnosis.

Urine is formed in the kidneys, the product of the ultrafiltration of plasma by the

renal glomeruli, followed by reabsorption of most of the water and some of the

solutes in the tubules, as well as by active secretion of some substances by the

tubular epithelium. Urine is collected and passed on from the kidneys through the

ureters for temporary storage in the bladder, pending final passage to the outside of

the body through the urethra. The kidneys, through the functioning of the many

nephron units, have the ability to selectively rid the body of many of the waste

products of metabolism, while retaining essential substances, and in the process,

they also regulate both water and electrolyte balance as well as the acid-base

balance of the body.

COLLECTION OF URINE:

For routine examination, any fresh sample of urine is sufficient. An early morning

sample is best voided when the patient arises from a night’s sleep because it is the

most concentrated specimen and has the lowest pH. This tends to preserve the

formed elements well. For quantitative tests, a 24 hour specimen is required.

Specimens for bacteriological examination should be collected with utmost care to

prevent contamination. Collection by catheterization (insertion of a sterile tube or

catheter through the urethra into the bladder) into sterile containers is best when

urine is needed for a culture. However, catheterization carries the risk of

introducing bacteria or other infectious organisms into the urinary tract when they

may not have been there in the first place. Therefore, most often urine for

bacteriological examination is collected in “mid-stream” after the glans penis in the

male or the anterior vulva in the female have been carefully cleaned and without

touching the lip of the container to the skin surface. This is a so-called a “clean

catch specimen”.

It is important to instruct the patient clearly regarding the type of specimen

required, especially if it is a 24 hour specimen. The early morning urine is

discarded and then all urine is voided in the next 24 hours, including the early

morning specimen which the next day is collected.

The containers for urine for a culture should, of course, be sterilized, and the

container for the 24 urine has to be quite large, sufficient to hold at least 2 liters.

PRESERVATION OF URINE:



<a name="br74"></a> 

The urine specimen must be examined within 30-60 minutes after the patient voids

to get accurate results. If there is a tentative delay in examination, the specimen

should be refrigerated, though this may lead to the formation and precipitation of

crystals which were in the solution at body or room temperature. A variety of

preservatives are available, namely, toluene, boric acid, concentrated hydrochloric

acid, formalin or chloroform, and thymol preservatives.

The urine specimen is analyzed in three phases; hence the specimen is divided into

3 parts. First, a gross visual inspection or macroscopic examination of the urine is

done to determine color and clarity/turbidity of the specimen. Second, a chemical

analysis is done on the specimen using a urine dipstick. The dipstick test is

performed on the uncentrifuged specimen of urine, but it can also be performed

after centrifugation on the supernatant.

The urine should be subjected to centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3-5 minutes, and

the supernatant is transferred in a separate tube. Strips of the reagent are dipped

into the urine and compared with controls to determine urine pH, specific gravity,

blood, protein, glucose, ketones, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, bilirubin, and

urobilirubin.

Third, the urine is analyzed under a microscope. If centrifugation is done for

microscopy, the supernatant is poured off. The sediment is resuspended and a tiny

amount of the sediment is poured onto a microscopy slide. The urine sediment is

then examined for elements such as cells, casts, crystals, bacteria, and yeast under

the microscope. These elements in the sediment are observed as number per a high

or low-power field.

**HEPATITIS TESTING**

H

epatitis is a viral inflammation of the liver. Measurements of liver function are

not really adequate to screen blood for the presence of a virus that causes

serum hepatitis. Very few carriers of the virus are actually jaundiced.

Therefore, carriers of the virus may show a mild derangement of more sensitive

parameters like serum transaminases. Most specific are tests that detect the virus

itself.

Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus and is vaccine

preventable. Hepatitis A is very contagious and found in the stools and blood.

Accidental ingestion of the virus even in microscopic amounts due to close contact

with an infected person or through eating contaminated food can cause the infection.

The symptoms are jaundice, nausea, fatigue and vomiting. The best prevention of a

hepatitis A infection is getting a vaccination. The diagnosis of an acute hepatitis A

virus (HAV) infection should show the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) as the

standard.

The viral hepatitis B infection is caused by the hepatitis B virus. The spread of this

infection occurs through blood, semen, saliva, and other body fluids. The

transmission can occur by the sexual route, sharing needles and syringes, vertical

transmission from the mother to the baby during delivery, and breastfeeding. The

symptoms of hepatitis B include nausea, vomiting, fatigue and jaundice. Many

carriers can remain asymptomatic.

Hepatitis B can be a short-term infection for some while for others it can turn into a

chronic issue that can lead to other health conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer.

The presence of IgM for hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in serum is required to

confirm an acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In acute infection hepatitis B,

surface antigen (HBsAg) is present and a hepatitis B core antibody test is done to see

if the patient has ever been infected. The hepatitis B surface antibody suggests that

the virus has been cleared after infection. The hepatitis B surface antigen may also

be seen in patients who are chronic carriers. Patients with clinical symptoms of acute

hepatitis along with the detection of virus strongly suggest acute HBV infection. It

could also be chronic HBV with acute superinfection by another hepatitis virus. A

chronic hepatitis infection is the presence of HBsAg in the serum for 6 months or

longer. The best mode of preventing this infection is by vaccination.

Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. It usually

gets transmitted through contact with the blood of an infected person. The most

common route is sharing needles and other equipment used to inject drugs. Most

often hepatitis C is a long-term infection which can lead to advanced liver disease

and hepatic cancer. Patients with hepatitis C are usually asymptomatic, but when

they present with symptoms, they are usually in advanced liver disease.

The best mode to avoid this infection is to avoid contact with blood-contaminating

objects and recreational drugs. Serologic assays are done to detect antibody to HCV

(anti-HCV), or molecular tests are done for the presence of viral particles to confirm

hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Anti-HCV antibodies can be detected within 4-10

weeks of infection by third generation tests which are more sensitive and specific. A



<a name="br76"></a> 

rapid test made up of antibody strips is also available. The polymerase chain reaction

(PCR) assay done for HCV infection is the most specific test for presence of viral

particles and is helpful in diagnosing acute HCV infection before antibodies have

developed.

Hepatitis D is an infection in the liver caused by the hepatitis D virus, also called

delta virus. This infection is usually seen in patients along with hepatitis B, where it

is called a “co-infection”. It can occur later in a patient already infected with

hepatitis B, which is called “superinfection”. Hepatitis D can be a short-term or a

long-term infection that causes serious liver damage and even death. There is no

vaccine to prevent this infection, but vaccination against hepatitis B can offer

protection against hepatitis D as well. Patients with a suspected hepatitis D infection

are not routinely tested for the presence of IgM antibodies to hepatitis D virus

(HDV). These infections can occur as superinfections with other hepatitis viruses.

Hepatitis E is an infection caused by the hepatitis E virus. The infection is spread by

the stool of an infected person. In most developing countries, drinking contaminated

water with the stool of an infected person causes the infection. In developed

countries, hepatitis E occurs due to ingestion of undercooked or raw pork, shellfish,

and wild boar meat. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but immunocompromised

patients present with symptoms.

Imaging studies are not indicated to make the diagnosis of hepatitis. Imaging studies

like ultrasonography or computed tomography [CT]) are done to rule out other

differential diagnoses like biliary obstruction, gallbladder disease, or liver abscess.

Serological tests are highly specific for hepatitis virus markers. These tests include

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay, and

microparticle enzyme immunoassay. The accuracy and precision of this technique

and the fact that it is relatively easy to perform means that it has replaced most other

techniques for identifying the presence of hepatitis virus in the serum.

**NURSING IMPLICATIONS**

If radionuclides are injected within 1 week before the blood test is performed, it may

cause falsely elevated results in the radioimmunoassay.

Hepatitis A: the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis A and

presence of total antibody (IgG and IgM) may suggest an ongoing hep A infection.

Hepatitis B: detection of Hep B core antigen (HBcAg), envelope antigen (HBeAg),

and surface antigen (HBsAg), or their corresponding antibodies.

Hepatitis C: diagnosed by the presence of antibodies to hep C virus.

Hepatitis D: early detection of Hep D antigen (HDAg) in the course of infection and

detection of Hep D virus antibody in later stages of the disease.

Hepatitis E: Serological tests for hepatitis E virus include detection of specific IgM

and IgG antibodies to hepatitis E.

**THERAPEUTIC DRUG LEVELS**

T

he monitoring of therapeutic levels of medications becomes paramount when

the patient is on medications with a very narrow therapeutic range, where

even a slight imbalance could be detrimental and critical. Therapeutic drug

monitoring involves the measurement of the concentration of certain drugs in the

patient’s serum to optimize individual drug dosages.

Blood samples are drawn to monitor for peak and trough levels and to see if the

blood serum levels of a specific drug are within the therapeutic range and not at a

toxic or subtherapeutic level. The highest concentration of the drug in the blood

serum is represented by the peak level, while the trough level represents the lowest

concentration.

**indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC)**

The RBC count is about 5 million cells, that is, RBCs (4-6 million)

RBCs multiplied by 3 get the value of normal Hemoglobin (Hb), which is 15 g/dL

or RBCs should be multiplied by 25 to get the SI units, which is 125 mmol/L

Hemoglobin value in men is 14-18 g/dL and for women 12-16 g/dL

The rule of thumb is that hematocrit is three times hemoglobin

For hematocrit value, the Hb is multiplied by 3, which is 45%

Hematocrit for men is 42-52% and for women 37–47%

“No Lesson is More Easy than Biology.”

60, 30, 6, 3, 1

Neutrophils: 60% (range: 55-70% or 1,800 to 7,800 cells/mm³ )

Lymphocytes 30% (range: 20-40% or 1,000 to 4,800 cells/mm³)

Monocytes 6% (range: 2-8% or 0.0 to 800 cells/mm³)

Mnemonic: “ **Please D on't D ie before visiting 500 places in life** ”

D-Dimer < 500

“Pat **learned to eat in a plate when he was 1.5 - 4 years of age** “

Platelets: 1.5 - 4 lakhs

**Serum Electrolytes**

Maggie and Phoebe are 1.6- 2.6 years old (magnesium and

phosphorus)

They ate 3.5 - 5 bananas (potassium)

They drank 8.5- 10.5 oz of milk (calcium)

Then they took a 135 -145 minute nap after swimming in the ocean (sodium)

But they can only swim in the swimming pool at a temperature of 95 - 105

(chloride)

**Renal studies**

BUN - think of the price of a bun. It costs about $5 but no more than $20 (5-20)

Creatinine - an ugly creature on a scale of one to ten measures about 0.5 to 1.5 (0.5-

1\.5)

**Glucose studies**

Fasting glucose - think sweet candies. I eat 70-110 candies when I am hungry.

Glucose Tolerance Test

Baseline Glucose – “A child between 7-11 years plays with glue.” Hence the values

are 70-110

Baseline: 70-110

Remember that 120 comes 2 times diagonally, and the other numbers are 70 and

170

1 hour: 120 - 170

2 hours: 70 -120

HbA1c - think of numbers 3,4,5,6 - the average of glucose levels over 3 months

and should be between 4-6

**Arterial blood gas**

Remember: pH 7.35 - 7.45

PaCO2 35- 45 (same as numbers after decimal points)

Bicarb- HCO3 22- 26 (between the ages of 22-26 we can buy cars)



<a name="br80"></a> 

Pao2 80- 100 (a person’s old age is between 80-100 years)

SaO2 > 95 (you are s uper o ld when you cross 95 years of age)

**Liver function tests**

Remember that AST and ALT have the same ranges.

A L T - L iver specific in the range of 10-40

A S T- S ystem specific (not liver specific) in the range of 10-40

Remember that ALP and lipase have the same ranges.

A L P - L iver specific disease in the range of 10- 140

Li p ase- P ancreatitis specific in the range of 10-140

Amylase - 40- 140 (the same second value as the ALP and lipase)

Bilirubin - 0.1-1.0 (reverse the numbers in the values)

**Lipoprotein profile and cardiac enzymes**

Triglycerides **:** <200 (want low as bad fats in the bloodstream)

LDL - < 130 mg/dl (want LOW or it will lower you to the ground)

HDL - >30 mg/dl (want HIGH for patient to feel in high spirit)

**Cardiac enzymes**

**Mnemonic: “The A ssistant C ommissioner of P olice TICK s me off Total ly**

**and My B lood boils when I see him “**

A cute C ardiac P rofile (ACP)

The first enzyme to rise is troponin T >0.4 (specific in myocardial infarction)

followed by troponin I >0.1 (specific in myocardial infarction)

and then creatinine kinase CK -MB >50 (more specific than the CK-Total)

Creatinine kinase CK - T otal >150 (more specific in muscle injury)

My oglobin - 5-70 (more specific in muscle injury)

B NP <100

**Thyroid studies**

Triiodothyronine (T3), Thyroxine (T4) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone(TSH) -

the test values decrease in descending order from T3 having the highest numbers to

TSH having the lowest numbers.

**T3 -** 75-200 ng/dl

**T4 -** 4.5- 11.5 ug/dl

**TSH -** 0.3 - 5.0 U/dl

The most common crystals in urine are:

Calcium oxalate – the most common crystals that are envelope shaped (the most

common shape we see because we send and receive email all the time)

U R ic acid - is r homboid in shape

Cystine crystals - cys sounds like six and is hexagonal in shape

Struvite crystals - most fatal and are coffin shaped (a coffin is fatal)

A SIMPLE STORY TO REMEMBER IMPORTANT LABORATORY

VALUES

T

his is a story of a rock band called, “ He avy Mo mentum”, that conducted

tours and concerts across the country. The band consisted of one man (heme)

and 4 women (oxygen).

Hemoglobin is made up of 1 heme and 4 oxygen. Therefore,

Hemoglobin:

Men - 14-18 g/dl (the numbers are 1 and 4)

Women - 12- 16 g/dl (minus 2 from men's values)

There are forums that keep a check of these band performances, called “critiques”

because they criticize their work. The crit iques forum has about 42 to 52 men and

37 to 47 women.

Hematocrit:

Men 42-52%

Women 37-47%

The payment of the band singers is decided by a R eally B ackward C ouncil

known for pay disparity based on gender. Hence the men get paid 4.7- 6.1 million

dollars and the women get paid 4.2- 5.4 million dollars, which is less than their

male counterparts.

RBC:

Men 4.7 - 6.1 million cells / cumm

Women 4.2 - 5.4 million cells / cumm

At the same time, there is a council fighting for women's rights called the W omen

B acking C ouncil that will penalize any forum creating pay disparity based on

gender, with a fine of 4000 - 11000 dollars.

WBC 4000 - 11000 cells / cumm

The Heavy Momentum players have some older players called, cholesterol, who

are on the high er side of age, who are really good singers, and these men are

between 40 to 50 years; the women are between 50 to 60 years of age.

They also have a few very laidback members who are really bad singers aged

between 60-180 years

HDL (good cholesterol) Men: 40 - 50 and Women: 50 - 60

LDL (bad cholesterol) 60 -180

The audience includes Aunt Thea, who has come with her family of 10 to 20

people. They all want to eat a hamburger Bun, which costs about 5 dollars to 20

dollars, depending upon the filling inside. These buns are served on plate s



<a name="br83"></a> 

arranged in stacks of 150000 to 450000 lakhs for the entire audience.

Theophylline 10 - 20 mcg

BUN (blood urea nitrogen) 5-20

Platelets - 150000 - 450000 lakhs

The audience can also avail itself of a free dessert if it has a glucose level within

the normal range of 70 - 110 mg/dl . And they get a chance to win a pass to meet

and greet the band members backstage if they have exhibited fair and good

behavior in other concerts over three months . If they have misbehaved more than

6\.5 times in the last three months, they automatically get disqualified from winning

the pass.

Normal glucose: 70 - 110 mg/dl

HbA1c Good control 5.7 - 6.5 % over three months

Diabetes >6.5%

A great singer who is very experienced called P atrick charges about 3.5 - 5 million

dollars for each concert hosted and sponsored by lithium. Patrick is the brand

ambassador for lithium, and he carries lithium bottles with him everywhere and

consumes 0.6 to 1.2 liters of it. Also, there is another new singer on the block, Al

bert, who is extremely good but also charges the same rate of 3.5 - 5 million

dollars. Therefore, this band could not afford him and they let him go.

Potassium (K+) 3.5 - 5

Albumin 3.5 - 5

Lithium 0.6 - 1.2

Patrick was accused of doing drugs and, therefore, he had to undergo a battery of

tests that included a urine analysis . His urinalysis and blood protein showed the

following results which were normal.

ALB 0-8mg/dl

pH 4.6 - 8.0

WBC 0-4

Glucose Negative

And his blood test showed:

Protein 6.4 - 8.3g/dl.

Patrick and another standby band member, So crates, are at loggerheads and share a

bitter relationship because Patrick went out with Am y, who is Socrates' wife, at

least 35-65 times. Also when Patrick is playing in the band, Socrates rests and vice

versa because of their complicated love story. They do not play in the band at the

same time.

Potassium 3.5 - 5 mEq/dl

Sodium 135 -145 mEq/dl

Ammonia 35-65 mcg/dl



<a name="br84"></a> 

Socrates and Amy have a daughter, Maggie, who is 1.6 -2.6 years old (magnesium).

She came to the concert and was hungry. She had 8.5 - 10.5 oz of milk (calcium).

After the concert, her parents took her to the swimming pool (chloride) where she

swam for 90 - 105 minutes.

Magnesium 1.6 -2.6

Calcium 8.5 - 10.5

Chloride 90 - 105

In the meantime, after the exertion of the concert, Patrick complained of tightness

in his chest and was suddenly gasping for breath. He was rushed to the emergency

room and a series of tests were ordered. His oxygen levels were more than 95%,

but the Trop I test was also more than 0.4. He was also tested for HIV because of

his drug addiction. The test turned out positive but his Cd4+ cell count was

between 500 – 1000, which was normal. He was informed by the doctors that he

had had a heart attack and he should slow down. He then decided to resign from the

band due to his health conditions.

Spo2 >95%

Trop I > 0.4 (indicates myocardial infarction)

HIV cd4 cell count normal range: 500 -1000

The band found a new member, Phoenix, to replace Patrick who was extremely

talented and also charges only 1.8 to 2.6 million dollars per concert - less than

Patrick charged. It was a win-win situation for both Phoenix and the band.

Phosphorus 1.8 - 2.6 mEq/dl

**CONCLUSION**

T

he ultimate goal for registered nurses and students is to have accurate and

simple information and to make learning lab values easy for nursing students

and working nurses. This book is written as a guide to provide a valuable aid

throughout one’s nursing career and especially to those taking their exams. Lab

values form an important part of the NCLEX exams, and it is essential for nursing

students to remember normal ranges and critical values to do well. This book keeps

learning simple and helps students focus on the most important aspects of

laboratory tests ordered in the hospital.



<a name="br85"></a> 

Nursing lab values primarily consist of numbers that can be very dry and difficult

to remember. The last two chapters, “Easy Memorization Tricks” and “The Story”

aimed to make absorbing these values fun and easy. When mnemonics and stories

are silly, it makes for an easy read for students and helps them retain the material

longer. These tricks come at the end of the book so that glancing through these

values in a concise manner becomes manageable when exams approach.
